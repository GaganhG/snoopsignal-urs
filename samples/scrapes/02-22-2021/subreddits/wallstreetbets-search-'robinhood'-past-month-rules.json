I'll go through all these pms and comments this afternoon with my lawyer friend. Keep em coming!\n\nAnd please share!\n\nEdit 3:\n\nOMFG guys I'm getting 1000s of PMs! It'll take a while to sort through them all and reply, but keep messaging and sharing! Also if you were using WeBull or some other brokerage and got blocked, you might as well join too.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit 4:\n\nMy team and the lawyers had a conference call, and it's on!\n\nWe'll have an update in the next 48 hours with the procedures and next steps.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please PM me and I'll try to get through as many as I can once we have more details.\n\nEdit 1/30:\n\nWork is ongoing. Sorry for the lack of news, the lawyers are still getting their ducks in a row. I'll update with more info as soon as it's available.\n\n2/2 Update:\n\nJust to let everyone know where we're at, my team is currently doing the research and building the case. This is a pretty huge lift though, so we're getting people on the team with the expertise needed to give us the best chance of success. It's taking time to get the most qualified people possible, but I want to do this the right way. I hope to have another update with good news in the near future. Thanks for all of the support and encouragement!\n\nPS, sorry guys but I literally can't open my Chats now. Probably has something to do with the 8.9k next to it.... If you need to reach me you can send a Message, or leave a comment and tag my username. \n\n2/11:\nUpdate: please see the [new survey here.](https://forms.gle/mPLrq329wUDboAdE8)"

My dad\u2019s wife\u2019s girlfriend is a powerful lawyer in Boca Raton and I\u2019m seriously considering retaining her services and filing a class action lawsuit against these citadel dick munchers. This has happened to me too many times. I\u2019m low key spiraling into madness. Donate to me on onlyfans if you want to contribute towards the legal fees. She\u2019s giving me a pretty kickass discount, but she estimates it\u2019s still going to cost $150k. This happens to be the amount I lost on gme, but this is not relevant to the conversation here. It\u2019s time to rise up and take down robinhood once and for all.\n\nAlso, yeah my stepmom has a girlfriend. It\u2019s 2021 you bigots."

You retards do as you wish, feel free to join if you want. Hell, use it as a backup in case something happens to WSB, I don't give a fuck\n\nEdit: Stop giving me these beautiful awards you retards, use the money on GME. \n\nThis is the way. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e. GME GANG FOREVER \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 STRAIGHT TO THE Nth DIMENSION BOYS \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: I will be acquiring more shares today. I have 17.7k liquid money in my TD. Bought 15 shares @327. Waiting for another dip to yolo 12.7k into the rest. I have 18 shares holding on RH with average cost of $112. 1000EOD Boys. Fuck the shorts, fuck the establishment. Melvin and friends can suck my fat diamond encrusted cock. Don't forget to leave RH a nice review on the app store thanking them for your gains\n\nEdit 3: I convinced my mother to yolo her stocks into GME early on @90. She still continues to add onto it and as of now she holds 147+ shares and is profiting well over 60k. I don't know what her cost average currently sits at but if my mother can \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e then so can you. She's more diamond-handed than me. Do your part brothers. We'll all be feasting on tendies from our golden plates and washing it down with Shitron tears as we wipe our asses with Melvin bucks by end of next week.\n\nEdit 4: I can't believe how much this is blowing up. I wasn't expecting it. But while I have the spotlight, I just wanted to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart. You tards have done absolute wonders for the community and started a financial revolution fueled by memes and autism.\n I read all these stories about how this community has helped people pay off their debts, care for sick loved ones, allowed people to give back to their local communities, and so much more. You guys are the true unsung heroes of this generation and are some of the most wholesome degenerates i've ever seen. This fight isn't about just tendies anymore, its about justice and equality, it's about sticking it to the corporate elites who run the world. Don't let these greedy scumbags take what's rightfully yours, for too long the little guy has been pushed and shoved around but now it's our time to shine. Keep up the good fight and don't back down. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e for days boys, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE SEE ELON SHOOT A GME THEMED ROCKET FILLED WITH THE BURNT ASHES OF THESE BASTARDS TO MARS.

POWER TO THE PLAYERS!\n\nEDIT 5: Stop spamming me with awards and upvotes, you retards are crashing my inbox! Put forth all this glorious energy into GME.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: GME to 1,000 EOD, GME 5000 EONW.

Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like \"money market fund\" or \"moving average\"\n\nSomething like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.\n\nInstead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS \"difficult solution\" they did.\n\nAnd speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying \"lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors\". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.\n\nAnd yeah another reason why \"volatiilty\" and \"trade volume\" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.\n\nEdit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl\n\n\nEdit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....\n\n\n#FUCK YOU ROBINTARD. YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM LIKING THE STOCK\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"

            "text": "Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. \n\nThat is not entirely true. \n\nRH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. \n\nThis is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. \n\nThey are simultaneously:\n1)  manipulating the system\n2) taking advantage of people with less funds\n3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased\n\nThey did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say \u201cWe reopened stock purchase of GME\u201d and nobody will dig deeper. \n\nThis is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. \n\nHere\u2019s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa\n\nEdit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas \u201cThe Shit Engine\u201d Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it\u2019s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what\u2019s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo\n\nEdit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.\n\nEdit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.\n\nHere\u2019s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg\n\n#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.\n\n#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.\n\n#Edit 6: RH is now down to allowing a single share.

Naked short selling, the illegal practice of selling shares that aren\u2019t known to exist, is just one possible cause of a failure-to-deliver, with more quotidian reasons being human error and administrative delays.\n\n\u201cFails-to-deliver can occur for a number of reasons on both long and short sales,\u201d reads a disclaimer on the SEC website. \u201cTherefore, fails-to-deliver are not necessarily the result of short selling, and are not evidence of abusive short selling or \u2018naked\u2019 short selling.\u201d\n\nFailures to deliver can result in fines, losses as well as reputational harm, and in rare circumstances there\u2019s also a risk they could lead to a reduction of market liquidity.\n\nOne thing is clear: the Grapevine, Texas-based company is an anomaly in the data. Ranked by the dollar value of traded shares that couldn\u2019t be delivered -- a sum that was influenced by the ballooning price of GameStop\u2019s shares -- it was the only company to appear multiple times in the top 10 during the period. And it was only one of two companies, the other being Li Auto Inc., to feature atop a list dominated by exchange-traded funds.\n\nThe data, which is released twice a month, tracks securities that had at least 10,000 shares that failed-to-deliver on a daily basis. The total number of shares for each day is a \u201ccumulative number of all fails outstanding until that day, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day,\u201d according to the SEC\u2019s website.\n\nAbout 2.1 million GameStop shares failed-to-deliver on Jan. 26 before falling to 138,179 on Jan. 29, the day after Robinhood and other brokerages began restricting trading in so-called meme stocks."

            "text": "I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.\n\nI also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.\n\nDisclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: \n\nWhen you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.\n\nEnter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the \"title\" for your shares, the folks who make it official.\n\n**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.\n\nIn addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.\n\nSo, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a \"failure to deliver\"? \n\n---------------------------\n\n2) **Failure to Deliver**:\n\nFailure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. \n\nIt has been on the FTD list for a month already. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n3) **Liability**: \n\nYou must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. \n\nRobinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug. This lack of collateral from Robinhood is important to note because the \"music\" never stops, trading low float/volatile shares just becomes much more collateral heavy on the side of the broker.\n\nHence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)\n\n\nI personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nCouple of semi-related notes:\n\n-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.\n\n-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?\n\n-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.\n\n-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. \n\n- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.\n\n- **What will happen now**:Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up.\n\nedit (2/1/21): Thanks for all the awards. I exited on Fri open. Now GME is likely in a holding pattern to crush IV. Best of luck to everyone."

Here's why that's a total crock.\n\nThis is not the first ever short squeeze. Nor was it the largest by any measure. The volatility of equities being squeezed is common knowledge and expected. GME **doubled** in price the 2 weeks leading up to the squeeze, on astronomical short interest. We all knew it was squeezing, why didn't Robinhood?\n\n*\"Yeah, but RH had so much more exposure than expected because so many retail buyers were buying it on their platform.\"* Well, duh. Why do you think stocks squeeze? Because of retail hype. And not only did Robinhood have the data to know and expect their user base to be in big on the squeeze, **it's their freaking business model.** They actively highlight popular stocks to attract new users and entice trading activity.\n\nSo WTF was Robinhood expecting? They just fell asleep and are entirely culpable."

This seriously is not helping any of your positions. You're more likely to dump what might be a solid play too early because you're staring at the ticker and have TP hands and panic when SPY is down 1% for the day. Think about all the times where if you held a position for a little while longer you would've printed. Robinhood looks amazing as an app and keeps your eyes glued to the screen. If the sell button is right in front of you at all times, you're gonna be more likely to dump when you shouldn't. Get a broker with a shitty looking UI so you aren't glued to a chart all day. Trust me, your relationships and work will thank you.\n\n**Access to penny stocks**\n\nEver want to trade OTC penny stocks and make some real bank? It might be a good thing that some people don't have access to them given the inherent risk. But for some unknown reason, RH makes it easy to yolo your whole life savings into 0DTE so penny stocks are pretty safe compared to the options you can trade.\n\nI wrote a DD on a penny stock on another subreddit and I got DMs about how to buy it on RH. Bruh please stop. Use a real broker.\n\n**Actual customer support**\n\nI haven't used Robinhood customer support for anything, but I've heard it's god awful. I'm gonna sound like a shill, but I've been using Schwab for the past six years and the customer support is amazing.\n\n**Instant transfers**\n\nAgain, gonna sound like I work for Schwab or something (I wish). Schwab and many other big banks allow you to instant transfer from your checking/savings to your brokerage account with no limit. \n\n**Huge assets under management**\n\nVanguard, Fidelity, and Schwab have 6.6, 3.3, and 3.23 trillion AUM. That's a lot of focken money. These brokers had no issues with the clearinghouses and did not limit trading on meme stocks. Gee Em Eeeeee would probably be 2000 if everyone used them.\n\n**Cool desktop/web apps**\n\nWanna look like a cool badass trader to pickup bitches at your local library? Schwab has a FREE trading platform with many cool features like the dark pool block trades. Add fancy crayons and lines to your charts too! Not gonna lie this app probably makes it harder to stop looking at stonks all day thus defeating point number 1. \n\n[Stolen from google images](https://preview.redd.it/kco97ssy16i61.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ccb7623017890bb5a0ea17d471ea54bec64c0f19)\n\n**Cons of not using Robinhood**:\n\nI'm not blind to the pros of Robinhood. \n\n\\- Looks cool\n\n\\- Options are free (Schwab charges $0.65 per option contract)\n\n\\- Easy to use\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo please, do yourself a favor and use a real broker :)"

When the poor fight back, it\u2019s called violence.\u201d \u2013 The Apocryphal Twain*\n\nUpdate: Originally **BANNED** on WSB for posting this because it didn't relate to stocks. THIS DOES RELATE TO STOCKS. If I get perma-banned for posting literally a discussion about the integrity of the markets, I don't care. Do it. This is about transparency. Fairness. Equal opportunities for all.\n\n\\---\n\n**Yes, there is a US company with assets of $63 trillion that you haven't heard about.** That's a problem. And it's time this company that's relevant to the $GME scandal testify to Congress. The People demand to know if the system is working fairly for all.\n\n**Their name:** The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"). *See* [*https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance*](https://www.dtcc.com/annuals/2019/financial-performance). **They claim the \"\\[t\\]otal value of active issues held at DTCC\" in 2019 was $63 trillion.** Simply put, they hold your stocks. That year, they settled $120.80 trillion in securities transactions alone.\n\n**What do they do**: Not much - other than **settle almost every securities transaction in the United States.** In an SEC Sample Offering Document, DTCC claims themselves to be \"the world's largest securities depository.\" *See* [*https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995\\_ex10-3.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1450922/000093041309002195/c55995_ex10-3.htm).\n\n**Why DTCC matters**: Robinhood relies on their subsidiary, the National Securities Clearing Corporation (\"NSCC\"), to help clear their trades. *See* [https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/). Here's a good explanation of what they do: [https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/trading-investing/depository-trust-and-clearing-corporation-dtcc/).\n\nIn a document on the US Treasury's website, it states the DTCC's shareholders are many banks:\n\n\"DTCC is a holding company of DTC, FICC and NSCC, which are independent legal subsidiaries. There is a single governance structure for the three clearing agencies. DTCC governance arrangements are available publicly and updated on a yearly basis (last update October 2009). **DTCC common shareholders include approximately 362 banks, brokerdealers, mutual funds and other companies in the financial services industry participating in one or more of DTCC\u2019s clearing agency subsidiaries, including NSCC.\"** *See* [https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP\\_DAR\\_Settlements\\_NSCC\\_Final\\_5%2011%2010.pdf](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/standards-codes/Documents/FSAP_DAR_Settlements_NSCC_Final_5%2011%2010.pdf).\n\nLet's get this straight, the shareholders of DTCC are the banks? They govern a $63 trillion company (in terms of asset worth, not valuation (come on, people, I know the difference)), by which its subsidiary inadvertently halted meme stock trading on? **How is this not a conflict of interest to the integrity of the free markets?**\n\nTo be clear, I don't know who these banks are. Can't find them. That seems *interesting*. One internet article claims \"DTCC\u2019s user-owners include: Citigroup, BNP Paribas, JP Morgan, State Street, UBS, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Virtu, Barclays . . . Mellon, Bank of America.\" *See* [https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing](https://netinterest.substack.com/p/wtf-is-dtcc-the-story-of-clearing). I couldn't verify this.\n\nBetter yet, read this email by Murray Pozmanter, the Managing Director - Head of Clearing Agency Services and Global Operations at DTCC, dated Feb. 1, 2019. First, he states that \"DTCC is the parent company and operator of the U.S. cash market securities CCPs, National Securities Clearing Corporation (\u201cEn Es C C (prevent auto-ban) \u201d).\" Yes, the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) that runs Robinhood's clearing work. Second, he states that \"**The DTCC common shareholders include hundreds of banks, broker dealers, and other companies in the financial services industry that are participants of one or more of DTCC\u2019s SIFMU subsidiaries, and the DTCC board is currently composed of 19 participant and non-participant directors.** Importantly, our ownership structure also ensures that we direct our primary focus toward addressing industry needs and preserving market stability, which is especially critical during times of crisis.\" *See* [https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf](https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/DTCC-4.pdf).\n\n**It just gets worse.** Back in the late 2000's, DTCC was sued for facilitating naked short selling. *See* [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720). *Does this, uh, sound familiar?*\n\nDTCC vigorously defended themselves during the lawsuit, arguing they had no role in the naked short selling issue. There appears to be an archived article stating DTCC's response to the accusation back in 2007:\n\n\"As DTCC has explained, short-selling and naked short selling are trading strategies.\u00a0 These trading activities are regulated and policed by the marketplaces/exchanges, the self-regulatory organizations and the SEC.\u00a0 **DTCC is involved in post-trade processing, which occurs after a trade is completed.\u00a0 DTCC has no regulatory authority over trading activity or to release information related to trading activity.\u00a0 In fact, as we told the WSJ reporters, we have no power to force the closing of an open fail, no matter what the cause, and we do not have the authority to force a buy-in**.\"\n\nThey also stated that: \"**Freedom to trade is a cornerstone of our equity markets and a fundamental principle in the regulatory schemes that govern the markets**.\u00a0 The SEC has flatly rejected the argument that there are such things as phantom shares or credits being created in the market.\" *See* [*https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj\\_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3*](https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054831/http://www.dtcc.com/news/press/releases/2007/wsj_response.php?lpos=3&lid=3). Boy, would I love the freedom to buy a stock I want, even if Hedge Funds mess up and nakedly over-short a position during a squeeze!\n\nThe SEC also notes that the DTCC has a surprising amount of power to halt trading on a security for operational/transfer issues of a stock or fraud called \"chills\" or \"freezes.\" *See* [https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib\\_dtcfreezes.html](https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-bulletins/ib_dtcfreezes.html). *But does this include jacking up capital requirements for overly-shorted stocks without any public notice and explanation behind the billion dollar deposit?*\n\n**Let's also get this straight**: back in 2007 they claimed to have no authority in **pre-trading**. Only post. So what the hell happened this month with En Es C C (prevent auto-ban) and Robinhood then? Congress, are you listening? \u00a0\n\n**Why this matters**: Recently, Robinhood's CEO Vlad spoke with Elon Musk on Clubhouse, an app where Musk interviews guests. It gets interesting when Musk questions Vlad about the decisions of the En Es C C (prevent auto-ban), the DTCC subsidiary, to post $3 billion of capital at 3 a.m. in the morning during the meme stock trading frenzy. I'll put down the most relevant parts of the conversation here:\n\n8:55 (Musk): Who controls those organizations, those clearing houses?\n\n9:02 (Vlad): \\[Awkward pause\\] Um . . . you know . . . it's a consortium. It's not quite a government agency. You know . . . **I don't really know the details of all that.**\n\n9:15 (Musk): OK . . .\n\n9:16 (Vlad): But, you know, and to be fair, we were . . . we were . . . uh . . . I think there was legitimate sort of turmoil in the markets. Like these are events with these meme stocks and there was a lot of activity, so there probably is some amount of extra risk in the system that warrants higher requirements so it's not entirely unreasonable.\"\n\n**\\*\\*Now square this with Vlad's earlier comments during the interview:\\*\\***\n\n4:02 (Vlad): The request was around $3 billion dollars. Um, which is, an order of magnitude of what it typically is. Right so, um.\n\n4:17 (Musk): This seems like this sounds like an unprecedented increase in the demand for capital. **What formula did they use to calculate that?**\n\n4:25 (Vlad): Well, um, yeah, just to give context Robinhood up until that point has raised, uh, you know a little bit around $2 billion in total venture capital up until now. So, it's a big number. Like $2 billion dollars is a large number right. **So, um, basically, the, and, you know, and I, the details are, we don't have the full details**, it's a little bit of an opaque formula but there's a component called the \"VAR\" of it, which is \"Value at Risk\" and, um, that's based on some fairly quantitative things although it's not fully transparent, but it's not kind of publicly shared. So, uh, there are ways to reverse engineer it but it's not kind of publicly shared. **And then there's a special component that's discretionary and that kind of acts like a multiplier.** And, um, basically . . .\n\n5:24 (Musk): Discretionary, like meaning it is just their **opinion**.\n\n5:29 (Vlad): **Yeah**, there, uh, it's a little bit, I mean I'm sure there's something definitely more than just their opinion.\n\nThe full interview is available on YouTube. Search: \"Elon Musk Grills Robinhood CEO Vlad Full Interview on Clubhouse.\" Can't post the link.\n\n**\\*\\*Breakdown:\\*\\***\n\nVlad is asked by this \"consortium\" to post $3 billion, 150% of Robinhood's entire venture capital amount, at three in the morning, or presumably, trading will not be cleared. However, Vlad doesn't \"really know the details\" of this \"consortium,\" but decides it's a good idea to deposit over a billion dollars in capital anyway. Moreover, this so called \"consortium\" apparently by contract can demand whatever they want to. I guess every reasonable CEO posts almost a billion dollars when asked by a group of people he doesn't really know too much about (around $700 million to be exact). *Yes, the figure was later negotiated down.*\n\nFurther, this \"discretionary\" posting requirement is completely absent in Robinhood's explanation to clients:\n\n\"**How do clearinghouses determine how much is required?**\n\nIt\u2019s pretty technical, but the process basically works as follows: clearinghouses look at a firm\u2019s customer holdings as a portfolio. They use a volatility multiplier, looking at specific stocks, to quantify their risk.\" *See* [https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week).\n\nI mean, man, is it really \"technical\" if the capital requirement can also be an \"opinion,\" that is, discretionary? That was conveniently *left out*. The fact is this: Vlad said one thing but *omitted* another. **Why.**\n\n**TLDR/ The Rub:** What is Big Money? It's $63 fucking trillion dollars. The point here is not to peddle some unsupported conspiracy. The point is to expose an **apparent** ***conflict of interest*** and demand those in charge of our markets to reestablish public confidence. If you're going to take away the People's literal \"buy button,\" the People better have a right to know why. **Don't pull a fast one on the working people at 3 a.m. in the morning.**\n\nEdit: Some of you smooth brained folks actually think I\u2019m saying this company is valued at $63T.

            "text": "Dear Robinhood,\n\nDue to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. \n\nYou fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.\n\nI LIKE THIS STOCK, I LIKE THIS COMPANY, I LOVE RYAN COHEN and FUCKING LOVE MY FELLOW RETARDS. We are not just lowly elite, we are the SUPER ELITE. \n\nAPES STRONG TOGETHER\n\nALL SHARES MATTER\n\nCan't Stop, Won't Stop, GameSTONK!\n\nEdit: \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 GME GANG Going to fucking ANDROMEDA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\nEdit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.\n\nEdit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.\n\nEdit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.\nNow here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.\nAtleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.\n\nEdit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING."

We've come so far. \n\nNow listen:\n\nIf you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their \"safe\" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. \n\nBut you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. \n\n([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \\- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))\n\nThese banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47\n\nThe fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. \n\nI'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). \n\nKeep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. \n\nMy positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls. \n\n<Obligatory rocketship emoji>"

GME. BB. and a few other stocks are only allowed to be sold and not purchased on platforms.*  \n\n\n*CITADEL pays Robinhood for their order flows which makes up 40% of their revenue.

As Tony's assistant, and I field all the initial inquiries for legal representation, and you requested to be contacted via email. Would you please provide more information regarding your potential claim.\n\nRobinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? \n\nWhat is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? \n\nWere you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? \n\nPlease provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nUpdate 3 My response:\n\nGood Morning Karin,\n\nThanks for getting back to me. My answers in black below.\n\nRobinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? I'm currently down over $20,000 and lost out on over $500,000. I have made a post to gauge peoples losses and they are in the 100s of millions.\n\nWhat is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? Robinhood is connected with CITADEL. CITADEL Hedge Fund is shorting these stocks and have lost 2-3 billion the last couple weeks due to the short squeeze. I have also read it seems to be a colluded effort by a number of brokers to block buying and only allowing selling of these specific stocks that CITADEL has interest in.. IBKR, TD, and CS seem to be working in unison to manipulate the market.\n\nWere you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? Not until 11:30am this morning where they sent a notification. You would not see the notification without pressing around the app. The notification only stated \"due to ongoing volatility some securities like AMC and GME are position closing only\". So basically they are only allowing people to sell their shares driving the price down to benefit the funds that are shorting the stock...\n\nPlease provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. I have a few thousand people that want to join a class action lawsuit. A number of individuals are already reaching out to other law firms across the country. If you see the current news financial titants, congress members, and many others are commenting on the collusion market manipulation that is taking place on Robinhood.\n\nI'm working to gather more information but the damages can be in the billions..\n\nThanks!\n\nUPDATED 4:\n\nI HAVE A CALL TOMORROW WITH ATTORNEY.\n\nUPDATE 5:\n\nI had a call on Friday with attorney and he requested all proof, screen shots, and links to subreddits.\n\nHe is reviewing the potential for litigation and told me he will get back to me mid week.\n\nI will keep you all posted."

MOST OF THEM.\n\nNow - go look at the front page of Reddit, the front page of your favorite news source, and the tweets of your favorite politicians. 95% of mentions of these shenanigans mention ONLY RH.\n\nWhy's that? Hell, you KNOW why deep down, but let's spell it out.\n\nThese prominent people - politicians, celebs, rich people, etc. - who are suddenly on your side would **love** to see **only RH** bite the dust. RH already had been disrupting the industry and taking business away from the established brokers who were charging ridiculous fees from back when you had to hop on the phone and call a broker to perform trades.\n\nThe second RH goes away, and other newer ones like WeBull get similarly targeted and scrutinized, what'll happen? Return of the $8+ per trade $1 per contract BS as the norm. Fees that go down with the more money spent, because brokers loooove rich people, and hate us and want to rake as much as they can from us.\n\nShould RH get reamed? Absolutely. Should all the other brokers that pulled these shenanigans get reamed too? You betcha. And right now, that's clearly not going to happen. I've not seen a single politician, including AOC, mention ANY broker other than RH. Hell, a congressperson drafted a fucking letter about troubling/concerning yada yada about RobinHood. Only RobinHood. **Again, MOST BROKERS did this.**\n\nFrankly, ANY broker that pulled this shit should be shut the fuck down. If not by the law, by their customers getting the fuck away from their thieving asses.\n\nSo, did your broker do this to you too? List 'em here. Hell, make a separate post about them. Upvote all of them. Let's not let them get away with this. They're trying to sneak out of a war they started and present RH as the lone culprit and make you feel warm and happy about class action lawsuits that'll get you a baconator in about 5 years. Don't let them.\n\nIt's clear the media and politicians all intend for those other brokers to get away with it. The ONLY way they won't is for us to plaster their names everywhere and make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore."

If naked shorting occurred in GME, there's good reason to believe the three named prime brokers and the DTCC may have shut down 1/28 for nefarious reasons beyond the sudden and potentially arbitrary \"collateral requirements\" stated**\n\nIf you\u2019ve read my\u00a0[last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lma1ev/illegal_tactics_and_dtccprime_broker_complicity/), I hypothesize that if naked shorting is present in GME, prime brokers and the DTCC (which is privately owned by the prime brokers) would need to be complicit in it, which adds another dimension to whether the retail shutdown 1/28 to stop the squeeze was done for nefarious reasons.\n\nOn the question of whether DTCC was right to shut down trading on 1/28 based on collateral requirements, I'm not an expert on this subject but I've seen many compelling arguments against it, including how did they arrive at the 3 billion number for Robinhood and why were they able to get negotiated from 3 billion to 700 million (per following DTCC's special requirements) and why was cash customers restricted vs just margin? And why was selling allowed but not buying, why not shut off both? Another interest point is that the DTCC has often been implicated and accused of enabling naked short selling over the years and that the DTCC is privately owned by Prime Brokers/Banks.\n\nOne question posed to me by a reporter was \u201cwho are the prime brokers involved\u201d? So I decided to do some digging and found this disclosure form\u00a0[https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)\u00a0which shows that Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan are Melvin Capital\u2019s three largest prime brokers (based on assets held under custodianship). As a reminder, if these prime brokers did allow naked shorting and the short squeeze had occurred, pushing prices to thousands per share, the hedge funds would likely not be able to pay that and prime brokers would be left holding the bag to cover (which would also suggest they would be disincentivized to margin call)\n\nAll three firms own and sit on the board of DTCC\u00a0[https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board](https://www.dtcc.com/about/leadership/board). (Note that National Financial Services (Fidelity) is also a prime broker they use but only 6 million in assets under custodianship as compared to a 1.16 billion each for Goldman Sach and Morgan Stanley, and 265 million for JP Morgan at the time of the disclosure snapshot (03/2020).) I found this to be an interesting data point and wanted to share with the board.\n\nNote, the same Goldman Sachs that has been repeatedly implicated in naked shorting cases (Source:\u00a0[https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html](https://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2016-9.html)) and given nothing but slap on the wrists for enforcement. Also the same Goldman that accidentally leaked it\u2019s own emails (while defending a naked shorting lawsuit) that implicated itself and other banks in participating in naked shorting, including quotes like \u201c**We are NOT borrowing negatives... I have made that clear from the beginning. Why would we want to borrow them? We want to fail them...\" and \u201c\\[stock is\\] trading at negative rebate with non-paying customers\u201d (naked short). In one email Goldman Sachs tells a client** \u201cWe will let you fail.\u201d (FTID, trade a stock without locating it) and an email from a Goldman, Sachs hedge fund client, who remarked that when wanting to \u201cshort an impossible name and fully expecting not to receive it\u201d he would then be \u201cshocked to learn that \\[Goldman\u2019s representative\\] could get it for us.\u201d (Source: [https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/](https://web.archive.org/web/20201028054857/https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/accidentally-released-and-incredibly-embarrassing-documents-show-how-goldman-et-al-engaged-in-naked-short-selling-244035/))\n\nAnother interesting datapoint is that Goldman was chosen as the firm to take Robinhood public\u00a0[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-robinhood-ipo-exclusive/exclusive-trading-app-robinhood-hires-goldman-sachs-to-lead-ipo-sources-idUSKBN28I328), so alongside with the Robinhood Citadel relationship (As it relates to selling order flow and RH making making 40%+ of their total revenue from it) there\u2019s also a relationship between Robinhood and Goldman Sachs, who they would do well to have on their good side ahead of the IPO.\n\nThe thesis of whether there were more nefarious reasons to the 1/28 shut down (which short squeeze was set to occur, and when Interactive Brokers CEO projected price would\u2019ve been in the thousands\u00a0[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today\\_interactive\\_brokers\\_ceo\\_admits\\_that\\_without/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmagzp/today_interactive_brokers_ceo_admits_that_without/)) is tied to whether or not naked shorting occurred in GME, because if it did then the Prime Brokers involved and DTCC would likely have been complicit, they would likely be holding the bag if a short squeeze did occur as well as blow back for allowing naked shorting.\n\nAs long documented by counterfeitingstock.com, \u201cthe short hedge funds,\u00a0**the prime brokers and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp. (DTCC)**\u2014make unconscionable profits while the fleecing of the small American investor continues unabated\u2026 The counterfeiting of shares is\u00a0**done by participating prime brokers or the DTC, which is owned by the prime brokers**. A number of lawsuits that involve naked shorting have named about ten of the prime brokers as defendants, including\u00a0**Goldman Sachs, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Merrill Lynch; UBS; Morgan Stanley and others. The DTCC has also been named in a number of lawsuits that allege stock counterfeiting**\u2026 Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is\u00a0**carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC**\u00a0and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail. The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. (Source:\u00a0[http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html))\n\nA former economist who worked in operations at the DTCC, Susanne Trimbath, even came out in this\u00a0insightful [article](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)\u00a0and blew the whistle on naked shorting being allowed to happen within the DTCC, I highly recommend you read the full article. Just to highlight one part of it, Timbath says \u201cThe Securities and Exchange Act of 1933 specifically gave the clearing house the right to require that shares and securities be delivered for settlement. It allows them to punish those who don\u2018t deliver by refusing to have them in the system\u2026 **The DTCC has for years ignored that\u201d** (Source:\u00a0[https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/](https://www.thekomisarscoop.com/2020/03/how-phantom-shares-on-wall-street-threaten-u-s-companies-and-investors/)). In laying out the case of whether naked shorting exists in GameStop, the nature of naked shorting means it's not easy to prove and there have been hundreds of lawsuits for naked shorting that are often settled out of court because of that, but if you\u2019re an investor in the trade you\u2019ve probably noticed that in the past three weeks GME has had a lot of strange things happen to the stock, including seeing a precipitous drop in price starting 2/1 and onwards while short interest supposedly dropped. These things all make sense if you consider naked shorting occurred. In the case of GameStop there are several very strong signs/indicators that naked shorting has occurred.\n\n**I will list some of the indicators that Naked Shorting occurred in GameStop below:**\n\n1. One indicator is GME's extremely high number of Fail to Delivers ([www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)), which are one of the top in the stock market over a sustained period of time. The website\u00a0[www.wherearetheshares.com](http://www.wherearetheshares.com/)\u00a0shows extraordinarily high FTIDs extending from 2020 to years back. Michael Burry tweeted that in May 2020 when he lent out his GME, it took weeks for his brokers to locate the shares\u00a0[https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en](https://web.archive.org/web/20210130030954/https://twitter.com/michaeljburry?lang=en). FTIDs can happen for a number of reasons, but to have this high number of FTIDs over a sustained period of time is highly unusual, and a stock with a high number of FTIDs is one potential indicator that counterfeit shares are in circulation and naked shorting occured.  \n \n2. Short Interest in GME has been extremely high at numbers significantly over 100% of float. As of January 15th short interest was 226% ([https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl](https://imgur.com/fN4fVQl)) of the entire float. While it is theoretically possible for short interest to be over 100% with brokers repeatedly leading to each other, short interest this high at 226% of the total float is highly unusual and an indicator of naked shorting occured, which is a far more feasible scenario because naked shorting enables short interest to rise quickly as you do not need to determine the shares exist before you short.  \n \n3. Institutions alone have held a staggering 177% of float as of 1/31 according to Bloomberg Terminal\u00a0[https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)\u00a0which is highly unusual and could be a strong sign that GME is rampant with counterfeit shares. Another interesting datapoint is Fidelity's calculation of retail ownership is only 0.1% float ([https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW](https://imgur.com/a/FtSOiCW)) which is highly unusual and unlikely to be true -- another potential indications that counterfeit shares are in play because number of shares to ownership potentially cannot be conclusively determined\n\nOn Monday 2/1 there was a momentous price drop, and that drop continued through the week. Given the continued high short interest and retail interest to force shorts into a short squeeze, the price drop made little sense, especially because short interest remained high and even if shorts had covered there should've been an upward price pressure. What makes the most sense to me is that the price drop was facilitated by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares in a short down ladder, described below:\n\n*\"Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit... By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of \u201cstrategic fails-to-deliver\u201d and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand\" (Source:* [*http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html*](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)*)*\n\nIn an ordinary scenario with short interest dropping and shorts needing to buy back to cover the price is anticipated to go up. As of 2/1 with GME's reported short interest declining with price also dropping, there are signs pointing to shorts artificially covering or lowering their short interest via the generation of synthetic longs using options to cover, which is in regulation of Reg-SHO -- and again, this assertion is supported by the high numbers of FTIDs GME has consistently reported."
