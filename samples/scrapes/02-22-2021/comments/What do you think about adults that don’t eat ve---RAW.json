It\u2019s their life and I don\u2019t want to judge their relationship with food when I don\u2019t know anything about them. No one always makes the most healthy choices, everyone has some weakness for something physically, mentally, or emotionally unhealthy. Whether or not an adult eats vegetables isn\u2019t even a blip on the radar of problems I have with humanity.\n\nAdults who don\u2019t feed their kids vegetables on the other hand... those ones I get very mad at.\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the awards!

A boyfriend when I met him knew I guess French fries and corn as the only potential vegetables. We\u2019re talking even *onion* being foreign. It was super fun introducing him to all sorts of food.

My mom genuinely didn\u2019t have the time or money and my dad didn\u2019t have the time or ability to cook.\n\nNowadays my parents are both much more well off (and my dad can DEFINITELY cook) but the fact that I grew up eating unhealthy (but easy and/or cheap) food has caused the problem of me just not wanting vegetables. I constantly crave bad-for-you food and have quite literally never thought \u201cI could could go for some veggies right about now\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m very slowly growing out of it but when you\u2019ve eaten a certain way for 20 years and all of a sudden now you\u2019re trying to train your body to want other things it\u2019s genuinely hard. It\u2019s like vegetables never seem fulfilling. Even my new favorites like grilled broccoli or peppers never seem to satisfy no matter how much I eat or how good they are.

                "text": "I just want to offer my perspective as an adult that has genuine food trauma particularly surrounding vegetables: *yall, I wish I could eat them!* God, it\u2019d save me so much (sometimes literal) grief when it comes to people deciding to grill me on being a \u201cpicky eater\u201d in my 20\u2019s\n\nIn my case, I can really only stomach things I can either shove into smoothies and mask with fruit/chug or stuff I can speed-eat and not think too hard about, because otherwise my brain starts replaying memories of Dinner Table Bad Times and I literally can\u2019t swallow it. I cant tell you how many meals I\u2019ve walked away crying from because they trigger something so specific, I cant even explain it. I\u2019m constantly saying \u201cIf I could like them, or even just tolerate them, I would.\u201d Its not fun to get teased constantly by people (ranging from friends and coworkers to complete strangers) and feel like your only options are A.) Spill the dirty details of deeply personal trauma to get them to leave you alone or B.) Pretend to laugh it off and feel even worse about yourself inside. Thankfully, I\u2019ve built a solid network of friends that I love very much who are supportive + positive, and care more about me eating flat-out than the schematics of my meal\n\nI beg of you, be kind to people who do things that you think are silly or immature. I promise you, I take my vitamins, I talk to my doctor, I go to therapy, I find my work arounds. Keep your thoughts about my food habits to yourself, please and thank you",

I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her kids (my stepbrothers) have some issues in the future, too.

Not technically an allergy. But definitely keeps me from eating it. \n\nI try to eat others but it really depends on how you cook them. Brocoli is fucking delicious though",

                "text": "I wish more people realized that, most of the time, when adults don\u2019t eat vegetables there is more going on than them just being childish. That can definitely be the case, but it sucks that people can be so quick to assume. \n\nMy parents kind of did me a disservice growing up by not exposing me to new foods. They just gave me what I liked. The healthiest things I ate were broccoli, carrots, potatoes, corn. I was this way until about 24, when I started dating a vegetarian. We were pretty limited on things we could eat together because of my pickiness and I felt bad, and immature, and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t want to be that way so I had to start trying new stuff. \n\nI can see why this problem persists, because trying new foods is HARD for some people. I have moved a lot of vegetables into the \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d category and that\u2019s about as far as I can get. I don\u2019t think I have ARFID or anything, but I have this incredibly strong disgust reaction to new foods. I can think something tastes fine or even good, but if I have this preconceived idea that a food is \u201cdisgusting\u201d (maybe from childhood?) then I just feel sick when I eat it. Continuous exposure can help but it\u2019s an unpleasant process and it\u2019s a lot deeper than \u201cbeing childish,\u201d which is something I have been accused of since forever",

                "text": "That's basically me. I have an eating disorder (therapy helped only a little), in the sense of i have to choke on a lot of vegetables, especially if they are steamed, mostly because of their texture. I can and like to eat carrots and peppers, because they have a solid texture and i. e. can't eat tomatoes or cucumber. If i eat something and bite on a piece of vegetable I didn't expect the meal is basically ruined for me.\n\nI hate this, because I know how much others enjoy it. I also love the smell of a great meal with vegetables, but I wouldn't be able to eat it. It's painful to explain people this eating disorder, I feel like an idiot most of the time. So yea, try to remember me and be nice next time you meet someone who doesn't like vegetables. :D\n\nI love all kinds of fruits btw, mixed up in a fruit salad, in cakes, I do not care at all.",

                "text": "I have ARFID (Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder). It works similarly to a \"food phobia\". Like most people with this disorder, I can't eat many food groups, and vegetables are among them. People with ARFID only have a select few \"safe foods\" (usually pretty plain food) and feel extremely anxious when they try to eat stuff outside of them. Not like \"I hate this it's gross ewwww\", more like \"vomiting, crying, nausea, heart palpitation and full on panic attack\".\n\nThis disorder is very real, it's on the DSM and it can affect adults. It can range from relatively flexible (restrictive diet and social discomfort, but you can still function properly) to extremely severe (can only eat one very specific food, very frail, usually need to be hospitalized). It always sucks. So many of us grow to see our disorder as a character flaw or a sign of immaturity and childishness, because everyone judges and no one listens.\n\nIf you meet an adult who doesn't eat vegetables or seems \"picky\" with their food, please do not judge them, don't joke about it or make snide remarks. Just leave them alone. They might have ARFID, and if that's the case, they are already ashamed of their habits as is and will just feel horrible if you call attention to it. Even if they don't have it, their food is still their choice.\n\nRead r/ARFID if you want to know more. This disorder is very real and it needs more attention.",

She also \"hates vegetables\". She rarely cooked at all as I was growing up and actually preferred feeding fast food to my brother and I over cooking most nights of the week. My mother was too lazy if I'm honest, something that hasn't changed. \n\nSo when I meet an adult who says they don't eat vegetables, I just immediately think they're a lazy person. Too lazy to learn to cook. Too lazy to try to eat a balanced diet.

                "text": "I hate to admit it, but I (usually) feel a little bit repulsed when I learn that a particular adult does not eat vegetables. For a number of reasons:\n\n1. The environment. Their carbon footprint must be massive just on the basis of diet.\n2. Health.\n3. Maturity. Humans are adaptable. Eat a food enough, and you get used to it. Aside from certain extreme disorders, most picky eaters could expand their palettes a good bit. And given the health/environmental/possibly parental modelling ramifications of eating a processed/meat diet, its pretty important to expand.\n4. Curiosity. One uniting trend I've seen with ultra-picky eaters is that they often view food with fear rather than with curiosity/utility in mind. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around being uninterested in trying all the various interesting foods and giving them an honest shot. Especially when food is a big part of exploring and understanding culture. I'm sure there are exceptions, but I have never known a super picky person who tries everything.\n5. Veggies are all different. This shows me that its often the 'idea' of veggies that repulses people, which is weird. I knew one person in college who didn't like the idea of eating organic things; processed foods seemed safer/cleaner. Which is absurd, given chicken nuggets used to be a living, walking animal with organs. And nuggets are weird frankenfood with no real nutritional value and simple, boring flavor.\n6. Complexity. Spicy, umami, sweet, bitter, salty, etc. Veggies can be prepared with all of these flavors. Veggies naturally exhibit these flavors, and enhance them in meals. \n\nOnce again, I understand that phobias exist and people might have all sorts of traumas associated with eating. So after those initial thoughts, I usually am a bit more empathetic.",

As a teenager my tastes improved, I started to *love* fresh green beans, purple hull peas, any kind of bean really, collard greens, lentils, quinoa etc. (I'm from the south so those are essential), got older and started to love raw veggies like carrots, spinach, mushrooms, and especially fresh jalape\u00f1os, Serranos, sweet peppers, all sorts of stuff. My mother is a damn good cook and I was just a picky kid. Only things I don't like as an adult are Brussels sprouts and kale. Now my wife and I eat mostly plant based.\n\nBased on this my assumption is that those adults' own parents were terrible cooks. Probably never ate anything with seasoning, probably never had a proper stew or veggie soup, probably never had the chance to try fresh vegetables with any kind of dip.",

I had a friend at school who would choose by preference to get injections than eat vegetables. She felt it was wrong that she had to eat things she didn\u2019t like, and blamed it on her parents and older brother. At 14 I knew that this was a shitty attitude. There are vegetables I don\u2019t like, but plenty that I do. If I have to eat stuff I don\u2019t like, I find a way to force myself to do so. When financial issues come in to play, frozen vegetables can be just as nutritious as fresh, last longer and are regularly cheaper. I\u2019ve got a lot more empathy for people who struggle financially and struggle to afford vegetables. But in the long run it\u2019s cheaper due to the reduced health issues.",

When you're a kid, your taste buds are way more sensitive to bitterness in things, so that's why kids are usually objective to vegetables.

                "text": "My eldest used to eat so many different veggies and varieties of meals, but I noticed once she started at school those tastes changed significantly, to the point I struggle to cook anything from scratch for her that she does not turn her nose up at. I feel kind of defeated by this as I think it may have been influenced by either bad quality tasting school meals or other kids sticking their noses up and her copying that. I am persisting though and always will include a side of veg done in a way that I know I would absolutely gobble down and she is at least back to eating carrots, peas, broccoli and bell peppers along with having a weird pickled beet obsession (like mother like daughter haha).\n\nI wonder if adults who dislike veggies could have been influenced in this way too and unfortunately just have had bad experiences with badly cooked veg. End of the day it is absolutely their choice if they want to eat it or not ofc, but I think maybe they should at least try a little bit of something a few times cooked in different ways before fully writing it off. I found a few veg even I was surprised at liking just by having it cooked in a different way or included in a meal like bolognaise, curry or stir fry or blended in a soup even. Different cooking methods and herbs/spices can make all the difference.",

If I eat something that has the wrong kind of fiber in it, I'll get *really* sick. It's not even a matter of liking or disliking, either. I fucking love oatmeal, but I can't eat it or I'll get violently ill. I used to quite like celery, but can't eat it anyone. My father-in-law makes really great stuffing every Christmas, and it smells and tastes delicious. I know because I had it once. Within a few minutes I was writhing on the couch, feeling like I'd just swallowed glass. Lettuce, Kale, pretty much any leafy green vegetable will do me in. I seem to mostly manage with some foods like peppers and carrots, but only if they're sufficiently well cooked. I tried eating raw carrots for a while as a snack, and my tongue rather enjoyed them! My guts, not so much. :(\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf someone's a picky eater by preference, I respect that.

                "text": "My fiance is more of a picky eater than I am, and we have a pretty set collection of veggies we've figured out he likes or is at least that we use in just about every dish. He'll try out something new occasionally, but for the most part we stick to the same things (which are luckily very versatile, and I can add extra veggies for myself if I want). My takeaway is that while not every vegetable is for everyone, there _is_ a vegetable out there for everone; there's so many different flavours and textures and ways of preparing them that I don't believe that there are no options out there at all, even for the pickiest eater (barring perhaps some very intense and particular allergies or health issues). \n\nVegetables are an important staple in a diet for your health and wellbeing, and to omit it _entirely_ (especially if you're not making sure to replace it with a different source of the vitamins and fibers that you're missing out on) to me seems like a very bad and unhealthy decision. That said, I also get the vibe that for some people it's almost a cultural thing, where eating vegetables is seen as 'weak' or something, which is several shades of messed up and really, _really_ dumb.",

Most of the times it's just not adding the veg, so it's not too bad, but sometimes I have to find a substitution. I told him from the start that I am not sacrificing onions in my food though, so as long as they're finely diced and cooked to softness, he doesn't notice them. His mam also told me the other day though that he has been a bit more adventurous with his food since dating me though, so that was nice to hear - he's gotten to be fine with a few more veggies, so there's hope yet!",

I'll eat spinach and lettuce on a sandwich. Green beans, cabbage, celery, carrots, etc I'll eat if it's cooked in with something like a stew. I absolutely hate the smell and texture of broccoli. I can't stand salads. Every time I try a veggie again and hate it, it just makes me less likely to want to try something else in the future.",

Its interesting to see what she makes, as it's often fragrant and looks pretty tasty!\nAlso me: we have a lovely garden from which we seasonally  enjoy beans, peas, tomatoes, peppers, onions, garlic, spinach, potatoes, carrots, zucchini, and hopefully we'll have more variety this year \ud83d\ude09",

When I went off to college, and got to choose exactly what I wanted to eat every day, veggies were not on the list. I\u2019m 24 now, and for the last year or so I\u2019ve been trying to get a lot more healthy, and veggies have made all of the difference. They have become some of my favorite items to eat and I feel like I have way more energy!",

                "text": "I figure they have their reasons. \n\nFWIW, I \\*can't\\* eat most fruit or vegetables. I'll wind up in the ER with the good old allergy test via projectile vomiting bit at best. And then there's the whole blistering skin, blisters inside the mouth, and the severe headache with blood pressure going through the fucking ceiling. Good times. :/  I don't carry an Epipen because fortunately, these allergies are easy to avoid. I just stick to basic salads, the occasional bell pepper, and the odd lemon here and there. No mixed drinks w/juice and they hold the avocado at the sushi bar. \\*shrug\\* \n\nI literally got on my knees and sobbed when I found out I was allergic to artichokes. I ate one, got blisters in my mouth and around my mouth, and told my allergist. He said I could never have them again b/c next time, my throat could swell shut and I could be dead by the time the EMTs showed up. I'm not the type to play Russian roulette. :/ \n\nThese are all basically cross-reactions with latex. I have friends that are vegan, and they know I could never even be vegetarian. I don't ask them to eat a T-bone. Everyone's happy.",

He had a stroke on the bench one day and can barely walk anymore, he was in his early 40s. I don't know enough to know if the diet is a direct cause of the stroke but it sure didn't help.",

He has lost 40lbs just by eating less the last two years but I know he'd be doing even better if he'd just add even a couple green vegatables to his diet.\n\nI'm the completely opposite him, I will literally eat green beans out of a can lmao.",

                "text": "Perhaps they haven\u2019t learned to cook them properly. Or perhaps they\u2019re just really picky eaters. Either way, not something to judge others by. \n\nMy mother was a terrible cook, and I grew up disliking most veggies, but eventually expanded my culinary experiences and learned to cook myself and that changed. A few things that helped included:\n\n1. At some point someone told me you need to try a new food seven times before you can (at min.) at least tolerate it. So I try and give new things a few tries before writing them off\n\n2. I used to chop up veggies really small and sneak them into other foods I liked to minimize their flavor/texture but would get me in the habit of eating them and guaranteed at least some nutrients. Examples include: adding things to curries, pasta dishes, casseroles, quiche, sandwiches, etc... \n\n3. I went vegetarian for a few years and  got really sick of fake meat products and decided to really invest time into finding/creating dishes that were not meat-based. It was a good exercise in thinking more about food and the various ways to make veggies palatable.",

Then I started cooking on my own, and I naturally came across vegetable recipes, which happened to look great, and I couldn't resist trying them. It turns out veggies can be very tasty and can compliment any type of food, from pasta and rice to fish and meat. If I stayed on my family's cooking habits, I would never eat them. Now there's very few things I don't like, but I also am willing to try anything, because I know the potential.",

Eliminating vegetables and plants entirely actually provides many people with a lot of relief from things like exzema, IBS and more.  /r/carnivore and /r/zerocarb are two communities that do this.  Most people end up reincorporating things one at a time to find out what they are sensitive to but others end up just eating nothing but meat and there are actually a lot of people that have done it for decades.

The crew was talking about food in the truck on the way home from a job one day and someone mentioned carrots and he was just like \"WTF is carrots?.\" At first I thought he was joking or maybe a language barrier as there is a lot if bilingualism where I'm from but no. The kid was legit ignorant. We even tried describing and listing other vegetables but he would just shrug or say he doesn't know. He basically would only eat pizza burgers, chicken fingers, and fries. Normally the crew was a bunch of guys that joked around a lot and made fun of each other but no one had the heart to tease him. We just felt quietly sorry for him",

You don't like vegetables? Ok. You don't like dogs? Ok. \n\nHowever! One of my favorite hobbies is to eat! My husband and I actively search out new food, cuisines, and restaurants to try all the time. I am not a picky eater at all, and I love expanding my palate. I've learned from experience not to go on vacation with a couple of my friends that are picky eaters - simply because our vacation goals don't line up.",

Veggies, especially if cooked \"wrong\" taste bitter. I'm a \"super taster\" but have always eaten veggies. I expanded my palate more when I discovered how to roast veggies. That brings out a sweet and nutty taste in most veggies. \n\nI also don't like things very sweet. My preferred meal is bland, but I am a very adventurous eater for a regular taster, but really adventurous for a super taster. I don't often like new things the first time, but I'll try it up to 5 times before making a judgement.",

I was the first child of my parents and in being so they were really anxious that i wasnt getting the right nutrition as a toddler. This resulted in them FORCE feeding me veggies. I say force because they physically had to ram veg in my mouth and make sure i got it down. Im no psychologist but id imagine this action has stayed with me all through the years and has been the main catalyst in my aversion to veg. I've tried multiple times to not be a weirdo and add them into my diet but they actually make me gag...\n\nEverything i eat looks so bland without the greens on my plate. The older i get the more anxiety i have about my health and diet. Ironically my mothers fears about poor nutrition as a kid has led to poor nutrition as an adult",

                "text": "I understand there are people with certain food and sensory disorders that have very basic diets with no vegetables. I am not judging those people.  \n \nBut if you are a functional adult without either of those factors, there is no excuse to not eat vegetables. I usually assume those people either 1. Only tried vegetables when they were a kid and swore them off forever and never attempted to try them as an adult or 2. Don't know how to and don't want to learn to cook vegetables so that they taste good.  \nAnother weird factor that plays into it is some men's perception of masculinity. There are men out there who absolutely abhor vegetables and get really triggered by the idea of vegetarianism or veganism because they see meat and meat-eating as manly and people who don't eat meat must be the antithesis of manhood. These kinds of men scoff if you try to put a vegetable on their plates. Nhl, I judge those types pretty harshly.  \nVegetables are honestly some of my favorite foods. Roast brussel sprouts or broccoli in the oven? Absolutely heavenly.",

Dude, you're missing out on a great steak with baked potato and grilled asparagus. Vegetables aren't going to make you vegan/vegetarian. They are a part of a meal. Hell, they've been whole meals for me with no meat. Expand your horizons. Otherwise, you look like some sensitive conservative pussy when you talk and act like a child that won't eat their vegetables... ;) \n\nBut, unless they make a big deal out of it, I really don't care.

But as I've grown up, nothing has actually tasted good to me. My parents ate them and gave them to me and I could never do them. Onions especially make me want to vomit. I don't care about the texture at all. But I was always told my taste will change as I get older. And it has a little bit. But I don't eat as much as I obviously should. Even the stuff I do like, I get to a point where I'm over it. And also I can't integrate them into things I liked before I started eating different things.

                "text": "Growing up, I liked very few vegetables that I tried. My mother was one of Those moms who made it steamed or nothing. Thankfully I live with a lovely hispanic man who learned to cook in a few different countries, and his mother comes over to cook in exchange for his work/help frequently. They're both phenomenal cooks and have helped me find ways of enjoying veggies. I'm a texture person when it comes to new food,  and if something is soggy, mushy, or crunchy when it shouldn't be, I can't do it. The natural flavors of some veggies make me gag. I blame under exposure for my brain's hate switch being flipped.",

He got all of his water through Dr. Pepper and whatever food he ate. No, he is not fine, but that may be mostly from drug use. He is still very thin with just enough fat to keep his bones from showing, his liver is fucked with Hep A and I can only imagine the size the of kidney stones weighing him down. Last I heard he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine. I remember asking him once \"Troy, when is the last time you had a glass of water?\" and he incredulously responded \"Water???? Hate the taste of water! I don't drink water, I don't drink tea, or coffee, or coke. I drink Dr. Pepper and that's that.\" And I absolutely believe him.",

I would never try something new because eighter I just didnt feel like it or my mom would make way to big of a scene out of it and it would make me uncomftable. I also never learned how to properly season stuff and what varieties of flavors there are to season stuff. So I thought all potatos taste like rosmary potato wedges when put in a dish. (I dont like rosmary that much). When I moved out I swore to me to eat better and I did. I have my Pizza only phases but I eat normally now with a lot of fruits and veggies and not only because its good for you but because its really delicious! My head now works like a database for dishes that I can combine and/or create from scratch. All it took were some basics and the realization how little it takes to change them.",

The show was going along nicely until the chef started on the fried rice, adding peas and carrots to the grill. One of my coworkers tried to stop the show saying \"I don't want vegetables in my fried rice!\" The staff assured her they wound make a separate, veggie-free bowl for her. A few thoughts about that.\n\n1. How can you be so unhealthy that you won't even eat the tiny vegetables contained within *fried* rice?\n2. This person's bad habits affected the price and quality of our employer-sponsored health insurance (she also smoked like a chimney). Could you imagine  if what you paid for car insurance was based on the average driving record of your coworkers?\n3. This person had kids. I felt so bad for them. Had she also been raised without vegetables?",

Which with billions of people on the planet, of course I dont care what 99% of them do with their choices.\n\nBut lets say you meet someone who you start dating or become close friends with. And you realize they refuse to eat vegetables. If I care about them, id be at least curious why they dont eat vegetables and how they maintain a healthy balance of nutrition. Maybe they dont like them, maybe they dont know how to properly prepare them to enjoy it, or maybe they are just too busy to cook so they eat tons of fast food. Either way, it wouldnt judge them but Id be at least a little concerned. I find that if I eat more vegetables, I feel better and have more energy. They can be really delicious if prepared right. Id just try to cook for them and show them what theyre missing.",

They're either amazing, or dogshit. I have never had an \"OK\" Brussels sprout. I like carrots in soup, and stews. But I can't eat carrots by themselves, cooked or not, I just don't like them. But celery I can chow down on. Cucumbers make me want to vomit, but peppers I can eat raw and whole.\n\n\nIf they just don't eat vegetables because \"vegetables are for pussies\" well still, that's their choice (even if a stupid one) and I would encourage them to take a dietary supplement to ensure they are getting proper nutrition.",

As you can imagine, this \"I dont wanna\" attitude flows into the rest of her life. She really is a difficult person to deal with because any peacful argument you might have with her, she cuts it down to \"I dont wanna, so you are wrong\".\n\nAlso she makes her daughter follow this, which really bothers me, but thankfully the daughter knows her mom is an idiot so she eats on her own food and whatnot.",

(This includes the people who only eat chicken nuggets and fries like a toddler, and then throw a tantrum when those foods aren\u2019t available, as well as the vegans, who travel to a foreign country and get really upset when vegan options aren\u2019t available.)",

They are literally so bitter that I can't stand them.\n\nThat said, it also (I think) is because they were boiled to within an inch of their life by my mother.\n\nAs I've got older I've definitely introduced more veg to my diet, but I tend to make sure that they're covered in spices. That way I know that I'm not simply boiling any potential value away, and I actually get to enjoy the flavour.\n\nI still struggle with certain veg, and really don't like the 'sweet and young' versions. So don't hate. We haven't all had the experience of perfectly cooked veg, and even if we did, we can't all accept the flavour of every one of them.",

                "text": "I don't think about it really unless it's someone I'm going to be dating. I was talking to this guy on Tinder once, and he didn't like any vegetables, any fruit, and he didn't even like CHEESE. When he ordered a \"hamburger\", he insisted on just eating a meat patty and the bun. I looked forward into a future of going out for dinner/cooking with or for this man and I couldn't do it. I love variety and trying new dishes, and I love cooking for my partner. It would be maddening to just literally eat meat and potatoes and bread forever. Or try to cater to that while still doing all the veggie prep for myself. It's fine if someone has certain (few) veggies they won't eat, but if they won't eat any? That's tough. Especially onion and garlic, those go in so many sauces and dishes I make, and the basic level.\n\nOh, and he also hated all pizza. ANY kind of pizza. \n\nEDIT: just to be clear, the guy ate meat, and had nothing against cheese from an ethical perspective. He wasn't a vegetarian or vegan at all.",

They should revisit fresh vegetables using steaming and roasting techniques (not boiling!) because vegetables are where the flavor is at in food. \n\nMeat is actually very flavorless on its own.

Occasionally in the morning, it would be breakfast cereal. Eating out, she would branch out and get something exotic like a plain cheeseburger. The only people I knew who ate like that were little kids and autistic people. This person was neither.\n\nMy favorite work lunch was a salad with spinach, goat cheese, mushrooms, onions, carrots, a little bit of tomato, and almonds or sunflower seeds. I'd occasionally swap in some figs or pistachios. I'd put some balsamic vinaigrette or dijon dressing on it.

                "text": "Honestly, I judge them harshly. It's always instinctual for me to to just be quietly rubbed the wrong way by people who don't like vegetables. I am aware of this and so I have to remind myself of what everyone is saying here, that its okay to just not like things because of taste, that there are people who have serious texture issues, that tastes are different, most people have never had good recipes with veggies, etc. But for me, I grew up in a house of picky eaters, where every. Single. Person. Will outright refuse to eat whatever it is they don't like, except for me and my dad. I used to refer to myself as a garbage can, because I would eat all the foods that they considered bad or trash. My mother wont touch anything with cheese, accept for occasionally pizza. She hates fish, red sauce, anything with tomatoes except for catch up, and everything she cooks are things that are so heavy on the carbs and fat, I never even realized it till I went to college, and back again and felt sick and had heart burn all the time. Her diet, if she could do it every day, would to have Steak and potatoes, Dr. Pepper, Coffee, and Gummy bears. One sister has a chicken sensitivity, so we always have to make a separate dish for her, or focus on pork and beef. Another sister will also not eat fish, eggs, most vegetables cooked or not, and is constantly eating and snacking on foods like chips and sodas and sugary drinks while never eating real meals, and has had kidney stones at age 12, as well as other health issues which are somewhat diet related.(To clarify, I don't think that being overweight is a real health issue because people are just genetically different, I mean she has had to go to the ER for stomach pain,urine track bleeding, and I'm fairly certain its because she doesn't eat anything but processed food.) My kid brother doesn't like potatoes. At all, which is just weird and frustrating for a kid to not like potatoes. My dad would live off of hot dogs and chili from a can with mac and cheese if he could. All of this combines into eating the same meals and processed stuff for years. I thought I had a stomach issue that I was born with where my esophageal sphincter would never be fully healed and I would have heart burn for my entire life. As it turns out, I only have heartburn when I eat at home for a few days with whatever they cook.\n\nOf course everyone eats other things, and they try stuff on occasion when we go out and such, and we had lots of steamed vegetables growing up because you can buy and keep them frozen for so long. But other than baby carrots, and veggie trays around holidays, we didn't really eat fresh vegetables or vegetable based meals, (unless you count potatoes and corn) I guess in my mind, the second somebody says 'I don't like vegetables' All I here is, \"You are a pain in the ass to eat with or cook for,\" Just like my family. Its negative, and not really true, but after spending years trying to get my fam out of their ruts and routines to try new things and be just a little healthier so I don't have to see them suffer from these health issues, I cant stand thinking of being close to somebody who is just like them. I broke up with a guy after three weeks because he said he hates pretty much all fruits and vegetables. Again, I could care less about weight, I'm plus sized and my main focus is not to lose weight but feel good. There's no way anyone can feel good without eating fruits and vegetables, even if its for your health and you don't like it that much.  We all do exercise to feel good and just live longer, that should be what being healthy is all about, and I was not about to get in a relationship with somebody that I was going to make food for and he didn't eat it, or switch my diet to not eating foods I liked, or make two separate meals all the time, or never eat at restaurants I like because they don't eat it. I lived like that for 18 years, and I am not going back. I've probably thought about this way too much. I should also clarify that I don't want to try and convince other people to change what they eat or execise, because not only is it bitchy and rude, but everyone has their own journey with food and health. \n\nI know I'm an asshole because I have felt this way about people with allergies too, where I've had a friend who was Gluten intolerant and lactose intolerant, but would rely on everyone around her to make food decisions and cook for her. She would say, \"Where do you want to go to eat,\" and everywhere would be a place she could not go because of her allergies, so we would just go to the same sushi place every single time. Once when she was at my house, she invited herself to my roommate and I's dinner of making crepes. I have a main recipe from my grandparents that turns out great every time. Have you ever tries to make a Gluten Free Dairy Free crepe without going to the store for all the specialty ingredients? Its basically impossible, and after hours of trying to cook something that slightly resembles a pancake at least, she had the audacity to say, \"Well my other friends made great gluten free crepes last time.\"... Okay, are they gluten free diets as well? Why don't you go eat with them, then. \n\ntldr: I associate everyone who hates and doesn't eat vegetables with all the people in my life who are impossible to cook and eat with because they are picky eaters. I know I'm a jerk, I'm working on it",

                "text": "Crazy how misinformed the general public is when it comes to basic health and nutrition. The \"best nutrition\" comes from MEAT, especially organ meat, and especially organ meats from ruminants. A quick Google search for the micronutrient profile of beef liver will prove my point. Vegetables, nightshades, seeds, and legumes do provide some nutrients, but at a much lower level of bioavailability, and with a number of seriously potentially harmful  consequences - google 'oaxalates' and 'lectins.' \n\nVegetables are NOT a necessity for human survival, modern nutritional research has proven this. There are no nutrients that the human body needs, that one cannot obtain from animal products. OTOH, a human cannot obtain all necessary human-essential micronutrients strictly from vegetables.\n\nThere is a reason why so many people dislike vegetables, and its much deeper than just the fact that people are \"picky\" or they weren't force fed them as children. Although humans are undoubtedly evolutionarily programmed as omnivores, we are also programmed to treat fruits and vegetables (and nuts, legumes, etc.) merely as survival foods. On the flip side, plants also objectively taste bad. They are also living organisms that do not want to be eaten (\"kale doesn't love you back\"). They are programmed to secret these toxins that are meant to prevent prey from eating any more of them. These toxins are what make many of us think greens are yucky - it's mother nature telling us not to take in too much.\n\nHave you ever heard of another animal species where parents have such a difficult time getting their offspring to eat the foods that are \"species appropriate\" and \"nutritious\"? I certainly haven't.",

                "text": "Wow, there are some posts in this thread that are just straight-up offensive. Plenty of people who assume bad parenting, one person outright comparing it to domestic violence, and a heap of folks with patronizing \"you've just never had them made well\" responses.\n\nIf you eat with a vegetarian, are you going to tell them their parents failed to teach them to eat meat, or they've just never had a steak made properly? If you grab dessert with a person who tells you they don't like ice cream, are you going to blame it on bad parenting and abusive generational habits? What the fuck?\n\nI'm near 40, and I'm in the \"doesn't eat veggies\" category. I've had them cooked well, I've had them prepared a hundred different ways, including any number by respectable, even high end, restaurant chefs. My parents both love veggies and did their best to get me to eat them. My brother loves them as well. To this day, I try various veggies over and over, year after year, because I *wish* I liked them. Hell, I would settle for being able to eat them without gagging, because I know perfectly damn well it would be a healthy thing. The fact? Most of them are utterly disgusting to me. Repulsive. Gag-inducing. Their flavor, their texture, most of them have been nauseating. A couple (though not recently, thankfully) have ended up coming back up along with the rest of the meal they accompanied.\n\nI can manage cooked carrots alright, and I like corn well enough (though that's more of a grain really), but beyond that, nothing. I have had one single salad in my life that wasn't utterly disgusting to me. That was unfortunately not a salad I can replicate, because it was a hand-made salad at a cousin's fancy wedding in a distant state, made with veggies selected by the chef that same morning from the small farm next door to the venue and prepared on the spot. That amount of effort, combined with a significant amount of a citrus vinaigrette dressing, made about half the salad palatable - I was able to eat most of the lettuce and some baby greens, still couldn't handle the spinach or what I think was probably radicchio.\n\nFunny thing? I'm actually quite healthy. I know that can change any time, and I'm keenly aware that I need to be careful, but I'm a healthy weight, have no cholesterol or blood pressure issues (despite a significant family history of these), no sign of heart troubles, generally speaking good health. People assume that \"no veggies\" means \"eats nothing but processed food and McDonald's.\" That's bullshit. I make fresh meals every day, using quality ingredients - I just don't include veggies. I don't drink soda or have other major intakes of HFCS, I don't overindulge in unhealthy snacks, and I watch portion sizes. Simple.",

                "text": "I\u2019m an organic diversified vegetable farm manager and something I always tell vegetable-averted people at market is this:\n\nThink about a raw steak. Would you eat a raw steak? Does it smell good? Does it look tasty? Is the texture nice? No. It\u2019s gross, right? \n\nThen why are you shocked when you look at a raw vegetable and think it\u2019s unappealing? \n\nMany vegetables ARE delicious raw, they DO have a great texture, smell, and taste, which means that if you\u2019re willing to prepare vegetables with a similar dedication to preparing meat, you\u2019re going to have an even more incredible end product. \n\nThe fact that vegetables won\u2019t raise your cholesterol or increase your chance of colon cancer or give you a heart attack or cause acne or harm animals or produce a huge carbon footprint is just a bunch of big ol\u2019 bonuses on top of that deliciousness.",

Wich are: Basil (A Leafy Veggie), Olives (For the Oil) and Garlic.\n\nTo be exact a good pesto requires: Olive Oil, Crushed Garlic, Roasted Pineseeds, Parmesan Cheese, Basil Leaves, sugar and seasalt.\n\nAnd technicaly speaking, this makes Pesto alot healthier than some Veggies and Fruits.\n\n(Source: I make my own Pesto ... i also make my own Noodles but thats not the point here)",

She's great at a lot of things in the kitchen, but steaming veggies for some reason meant that you dunked said veggies in a tupperware-container, added some water and nuked the whole thing in the microwave until it was soggy and bland.  \nIt took me about 2-3 years living on my own until my culinary exploration had rebuilt that trust..\n\nIt's only the last 6-7 years she's come around on that front and I can only assume that she noticed what my sister and brother-in-law were doing with their veggies whenever we had family dinners at their place and had some realization.",

My wife is a good cook. I am even a good cook (so I've been told, and I cook with vegetables). I've been to countless restaurants where I'm assuming a large number of the chefs are good cooks.\n\nSo either every single person who's ever served me vegetables sucks at preparing/cooking them and everyone around me is a liar...OR, and bear with me on this one...I just don't like vegetables.\n\nI will clarify. I don't dislike all vegetables. I like potatoes done a certain way. Mashed or roasted(crispy) but I can't stand those mini ones that you just boil and serve. I like cucumber and I like raw carrots. Those are probably the only ones I actually enjoy eating.\n\nOnions I can barely stand. They're absolutely disgusting. I can only have them when they've been chopped to the tiniest sized pieces and cooked until they disappear and people say \"You can't even taste them\" so I question the point in having them in there at all.\n\nShoutout to /r/onionhate",

Everything she made was from a can, ready to serve sort. Even her holiday pudding or pies were ready made. The only thing they ever cooked well was meats!\n\nI started experimenting with more fun veggies, honey carrots and roasted broccoli, even fresh steamed broccoli was something new.

I have tried to like veggies for my entire adult life; trying new ones and trying new recipes, with very little success.

Even with meat, dressing, etc; I can only taste cut grass.  I wish I enjoyed salads, I wish I could even stomach them, but I\u2019ve accepted it will never happen.  \n\nThere are veggies I eat, and I\u2019ve found recipes to sneak them into for myself; so it\u2019s not as if I actually never eat them.",

I unfortunately did not get this recipe before she passed away, she'd told me she'd written it down somewhere but when I looked in her recipe book it wasn't there... that being said I think I remember most of the ingredients and if I take the time I'll figure it out! Also want to add in that grandma hated modern Entenmann's cakes... she said back in the 50s and 60s it was a thousand times better, and the quality drop is just disappointing.\n\n90% of the times I've had zucchini or squash though it's disgusting mush to the point where I'm intensely wary of it unless it's made by someone I know can actually cook.",

                "text": "Cycling to a ketogenic diet with very few vegetables and carbs can actually be a great choice for health if you only do it for a few months at a time. \n\nThe lack of glucose in the bloodstream triggers a metabolic state called ketosis, where the body rotates from burning simple sugars to burning fat for energy.\n\nSo, the idea is you eat only meat or animal products (or nuts and low-carb, high energy food for vegetarians and vegans) for a couple months before you transition back to eating vegetables. It cuts fat and there\u2019s growing evidence that it helps protect against a variety of neurological and physiological disorders. Meat only diets were used successfully to treat diabetes before insulin, it\u2019s one of the main treatment plans for epilepsy, and there\u2019s research currently being done to see how keto diets do with things like cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, etc.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also not something a healthy person should want to (or can) maintain for more than a few months at a time.",

I'm teaching him that junk food is good but not if you only eat junk food, there's a good balance in life.

                "text": "I've always loved well made veggies, but I'm white. Dating a black guy who grew up on a mixture of traditional African-American (mom) and Jamaican (dad) cuisine I've been introduced to so many foods! Collared greens, curry goat, oxtails (my absolute favorite), jerk chicken, etc. So far I've loved everything! I absolutely love trying new foods and was so excited to try the stuff he and his family like. He said none of his friends are ever willing to try oxtail. One of my fondest memories was my gran asking what I was eating and when I said I'd ordered oxtail from a small Jamaican place she got all happy and said she hadn't eaten oxtail since she was a little kid (they were poor and oxtail was dirt cheap back then, considered scrap); I ended up letting her try a bit (it was prepared differently, so she wanted to make sure she liked it first) and then giving her 1/2 my dinner (it was enough for both of us) when she liked it because she just looked so happy. She died a few months later, so I really cherish that memory of sharing a meal with her that she'd loved but hadn't eaten since she was a kid.\n\nIn return I've gotten him into seafood. He'd only ever eaten shrimp and whitefish. I grew up practically living on seafood, it's very near and dear to my heart. So I got him eating sushi (he thought he hated it because he had only tried that nasty shit at chinese food buffets), calamari, salmon and swordfish steaks, lobster, clams and muscles, and even raw clam and oyster. He was a little wary about the raw clam and oyster, which I'll admit the texture is a bit off-putting, but he ended up really enjoying it.\n\nI love introducing people to food and being introduced to foods. I love people who are curious about new foods instead of being afraid to try new things. My outlook with new foods is \"worst comes to worst I hate it and never eat it again\" that doesn't seem like a big deal to me. The only things I won't try are like dog, cat, and anything too intelligent or endangered (so like eating a dolphin would be a no)... on top of anything cruel (like sharkfin soup... if they used the whole shark that'd be fine, I'm fine with people using the fins for one thing and using the rest of the shark to make steaks or w.e., but no they toss them back into the water to slowly die).",

If they are a part of something, but not the main component to it, depending on the vegetable, I will have it (think fried rice, a tomato sauce if the re isn't huge chunks of tomatoes, something like that). I find vegetables not to be appetizing mainly due to texture. I have some MAJOR issues with food textures, like make me vomit if I try to eat something with a texture I don't like. I like the favor of many things, but the texture of it runs it for me (love strawberry flavor, hate actually eating a strawberry. I have tried plenty of properly prepared foods, I still don't like them. I WANT to like these things, but I don't. I keep coming back to them to make sure I haven't changed. I was always told I would like them when I grew up, and my parents always offered as a kid but never forced the issue. My wife lives veggies and I do most of the cooking, I have learned how to properly prepare them for her and she loves what I cook. I always try them and maybe some day I will come around, I am really hoping so. All of this to say, you are probably right about most people. I'm pretty health conscious, so I supplement. I have learned in my adult life, most people are bad cooks, and don't know how to properly prepare anything, much less things that need more help and precision. I pretty childishly avoided veggies and fruit through my teens (among many other things) but have expanded my diet since then with other things I like. I would agree that most people probably are being childish about it, tho I really try hard not to be.\n\nMy oldest son is autistic and I see a lot of myself in him when he eats. Super sensitive with food. Could probably eat the same meal day in and day out without an issue. We try to get him to eat other foods, but it is a big obstacle for him at times. Hopefully he comes around more one day, of not he will be fine.",

I used to have panic attacks if I had to go eat somewhere, because the thought of eating food I didn't want to eat was so treacherous to me. I was completely repulsed to the point of high stress levels when faced with, say, a salad. \n\nAt age 18 or so I couldn't live with the shame anymore, so I handled it the only way I knew how... by force feeding myself food I didn't want to eat. I had a few horrifying experiences at first, but no joke by age 20, I completely kicked the problem and the obesity.\n\n15 years later and I've kept all the weight off, and will eat pretty much anything. I'll eat the world's blandest vegetables and the ocean's squiggliest creatures. It's all good to me. Even food that I truly don't like (like watermelon), doesn't cause me any stress. I can just eat it with mild displeasure.\n\nDon't know if this method would work for everybody, but food for thought. It is pretty shameful for a grown adult to be such a picky eater. Plus, you really would be missing out on some truly amazing things to eat.",

I have an interesting story for it lol:\n\nWe were going to stay at our mum\u2019s close friend\u2019s house after they came to ours. Me and my sister went there first because they had empty seats in their car and our family will go there the next day. \n\nWe reached their house just in time for dinner. We had pasta, it was great, until a big bowl of salad was served. It was a mix of Olives, Kale, Avocado and vinegar as dressing, mainly Kale. \n\nIt was a nightmare dish, it looks like a nightmare, it smells like a nightmare, it must taste like a nightmare. I hated Olives, I thought Avocados were gross and I definitely do not consider vinegar as a salad dressing. And then there\u2019s Kale, a veggie I\u2019ve never heard of, wonder what it tastes like. \n\nMy mum\u2019s friend put it on the table and said: \u201cserve yourselves, okay?\u201d And I thought \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna eat that\u201d. Few minutes passed and she walked past, saw my plate and asked: \u201cSuspiciousLambSauce, why aren\u2019t you eating the salad? Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019ll take some for you\u201d and she took a spoonful of it and put it on my plate. I\u2019m not good at rejecting people other than my family members so I just quietly accepted it. \n\nI scooped half a spoon of it and put it in my mouth. It tastes bad, like real bad. It\u2019s hard and spiky, I thought I was eating rocks. But I had to act like I liked it because it\u2019d be rude to do otherwise. There were like 5 spoons of Kale on my plate, every spoon was painful. But after a few minutes I finally finished it.\n\nShe came again, saying: \u201clooks like you liked the salad, take more! Aww... don\u2019t be shy, I know you eat a lot!\u201d *proceeds to take 2 spoons full of Kale and put it on my plate, again*. And that\u2019s how I came to hate Kale.\n\nI was just a 13 yo kid though, maybe if I taste it now I might like it but who knows",

It's cheap and I find that peas taste pretty good (kinda sweet and salty) and have a nice texture. For other vegetables, it's really just about not overcooking them so they still maintain some firm texture rather than just being soggy",

I would go into panic before meal times because I knew what was coming, the yelling, insults, threats, being negatively compared to other kids who liked veggies, the tears, anxiety and gagging.\nI have never and will never do that to my kids.\n\nSure, my family was trying to make sure I ate my vegetables so I could be healthy, and utterly destroyed my mental health, self esteem and relationship with food in the process.\n\nI do like veggies and fruits now, lots of them, but there are some I still just won't eat. It's taken years to get over, something I'm still working on.\nMy own kids are picky too. I offer them lots of vegetables and fruit but I don't make a huge issue if they don't like it or won't try it at first. I'll keep offering until they're ready to try it, but I absolutely will not bully, belittle or berate them for not liking something. And it's working out pretty well. It takes a little time for them to learn to like new foods, but slow progress is still progress! And I 100% refuse to have crying and panic attacks at the table over a goddamn carrot.",

I'm also vegetarian which makes it a bit fucked because that means I only eat stuff like rice, noodles, dairy, etc. I mean it's fine for me but fucked up when you look at it from anyone else's perspective. I eat fruits sometimes but not as much as I should.\n\nFor example, at university, I had pizza served with lettuce on the side every week and tried a bite of it every single time to attempt to force myself to enjoy it, and I just couldn't. It's a texture issue for me, there are just tons of food with texture I hate and many of them are vegetables.\n\nEven the ones I can tolerate, I would just rather have food without it to enjoy it more. Good food is genuinely one of the only things that makes me truly happy when I'm working full-time so I always want a great meal instead of just tolerating food I dislike.",

But I can't help it. I try. i really do, but for me food can't just taste good, it has to be the right texture (most fruits and vegetables I've had just don't \"feel\" right), right temperature, can't smell weird, shit it even has to *look* good. There's some foods I like that I still can't eat if it isn't prepared correctly, like I won't eat chicken strips if they aren't hot and crispy, or a burger if the cheese used is wrong or if it's cooled down, or even fucking cheapest ramen noodles if they were cooked too long and are slightly mushy. I don't like spaghetti if the sauce-to-noodle ratio is wrong, I can't eat mashed potatoes if they aren't *juuuust* the right creaminess.  I hate it so much. I *want* to be adventurous, but I can't afford to buy food that I might end up throwing out. I *hate* feeling like an asshole bc I had to turn down the food someone so generously offered me because it's got one single ingredient that sets my mind into \"disgust\" mode, and it'd be more rude to sit there and pick bits out (even though I still probably wont eat the rest bc my brain is stuck). I'm not trying to be an asshole, I am ashamed and self-aware *every. Single. Time* I eat with anyone who i am not intimately familiar and comfortable with, and hearing people constantly liken me to a child because of it hurts.",

Mushy and not a lot of flavor. \n\nMost veggies (including broccoli) only need to be cooked for a couple of minutes. I go by veggie color/texture but I think 10-15 min is probably more than enough for most non-root veggies (i.e. potatoes and carrots take longer)\n\nThat said, some veggies do stand up to freezing and can come out ok. I like to buy the \"asian veggie blend\" for making stir fry. Broccoli and water chestnuts seem to be okay even after freezing.

                "text": "It's just a case of how long you cook it for and how. This applies to most foods. When you apply heat to food over time it's structure breaks down. Raw brocolli is tough and crunchy. As it's structure breaks down it will become softer. If it's cooked with liquid presesnt liquid like in a pot of boiling water, it will also absorb some of that water - the water will enter the gaps which are formed by its structure breaking down - this means you can season foods by cooking them in something other than plain water. Eventually the structure will break down so much that it falls apart and becomes mushy - this is the classic overboiled broccoli that makes people believe they don't like brocolli. \n \nIf you're careful and boil the brocolli for just a few minutes it can be crunchy and juicy without being tough. If you boil it in salted water or stock you will also season it a little. \n \nNow, what happens when we cook food without water present? We're still breaking down it's structure, but there are a couple of key differences. \n\nFirstly temperature - unless we're using a pressure cooker, water prevents food from being heated above 100 degrees because the water turns to steam which will remove any excess heat. Sometimes you want those higher temperatures because they enable chemical reactions which bring out more intense flavours, but it also means we can burn food it it's cooked for too long, and if the heat is too high or the pieces of food are too big you risk burning the outside before the inside is cooked - a common mistake when barbecuing. \n \nSecondly, you're actually going to remove the water which is already present in the food. The absence of water is what makes food crispy. Consider a potato. Raw it's tough and crunchy. Boiled it's soft. Underboiled it's a bit too tough. Overboiled it's mushy. But if you cut it into small pieces (so the water can escape more easily) and bake or fry it, it's crispy.",

                "text": "> I have no idea how to make it crunchy instead of soggy.\n\nThe trick is to not cook it too much. Remember that most vegetables can be eaten raw, and in their raw form, they are usually crunchy and firm. Most people boil broccoli or steam it in the microwave to soften it up, but that can make it mushy very quickly. If you want it to maintain its crunch, either boil it only for a very quick period of time (like 1 minute) and then quickly put it in cold water, or just pan fry it like in a stir fry or something for a few minutes.",

                "text": "Very easy! Chop them up into large bite size (nice trick, cut the big stem off, then place it leafy side down and cut downwards - less mess!) You can also buy them pre-cut in bags and some stores. Place them in a pot with about an inch of water. Most of the broccoli isn't in the water. Medium heat. Keep the lid on. When you start to smell it, it's done. Poke it with a fork to see if it's too soft or too crunchy. Or eat one. This is how you learn to cook. It's ok to mess up. The longer you steam it, the softer it gets. \n\nDrain the water, add salt, pepper, and a tablespoon olive oil or butter for flavor.\n\nAlso, raw broccoli dipped in ranch dressing is a favorite snack of mine - very crunchy! (I know, ranch isn't healthy... Bite me)\n\nWe eat steamed broccoli at least once a week, and my toddler children love it (go figure, those weirdos)",

Completely unseasoned meats.  Pasta with so little sauce that it literally just tastes like plain pasta.  I don't understand how she hasn't grossed *herself* out by now.\n\nMy father in law is probably a big part of the problem because he praises literally everything she makes no matter the state it's in.  I've seen him on multiple occasions say something like \"this is delicious, thank you\" as he raises his first forkful to his mouth, and I'm just rolling my eyes because it has to be obvious even to her that he hasn't even tried it yet.

                "text": "So I just wanted to share my story of an \"adult\"(19) I literally can't eat vegetables. It's like a texture thing I can't handle. The only vegetables I can eat are cooked green beans, cooked carrots, and raw olives. I feel super embarrassed. I've seen those clips of really fat people trying vegetables and gagging and that's literally how I also react. I really wish I could just eat them. I have no problem with the taste just the texture of biting into something crunchy (I only like chips in the crunchy verse) makes my whole body say \"no no not food\" it's so embarrassing to go out with people and ask for everything plain or with no veggies. I've often asked my parents why they didn't just make me eat vegetables when I was a kid and my dad says he \"would never make me eat something I didn't want to\" . My mom says when I was a baby I would eat everything, so I don't know what happened and why I can't eat them.",

One day I wanted to make brussel sprouts, my boss at that time panicked, he kept saying he wouldn't eat it and he never liked brussel sprouts, so I made him something else instead of the sprouts but everyone else wanted to have it except for another guy. I am very confident with my cooking skills, I grew up eating and watching my sister cook great food, so I learned some nice ideas.\n\nWhen they both tried a small piece of brussel sprouts they were shocked, my former boss hated admitting being wrong about something and he just went silent for 20 minutes and ate his meal, the other guy loved it, he actually took more and finished it all, he said his mom never made brussel sprouts like that.\n\nAfter being quiet for 20 minutes, my former boss gets up and asks if he could take more, I was so proud of myself that moment, he also said his mom never cooked brussel sprouts that way and I screamed in excitement \"That's the thing buddy, I'm not your mom!\"\n\nThat was a great lunch!",

Only veggies I liked growing up were carrots and celery because I would eat them raw.  My wife teased me about being a picky eater but she never had to eat my mom's home cooking.  Then one trip to see my mom and she decided to cook for us.  Boiled asparagus.  I was eating and watching my wife the whole time.  She took a piece of asparagus and ate it and immediately looked up at me with a grimace.  She now understands why I don't like many vegetables and have been eating more lately since I am replacing bad memories with good ones.\n\nEven worse was I hated salads because there was always dressing, mostly vinaigrettes and I hate vinegar.  My parents would force me to eat salads with shit I hated and it wasn't until after college that I started eating them again.  A little oil, salt, pepper and I'll devour a salad.",

I once tried to eat liver when I was 5 - kinda hard for a kid's digestion so I puked it all. And for the next 20 years, not only I wasn't be able to stomach cooked liver, I couldn't even *smell* it without actually getting nausea.\n\nJust to clarify, I have a strong stomach; when it comes to smell I can stand sewers, chemicals, gas, rotten fish, etc. But liver? Literally had to block my noise cause I feel vomit come up my throat, and if you ate liver you know it got a pretty strong smell. My mom's friend has this magic method of cooking liver with so much garlic the two ingredients cancel each other's smell, and for the first time in 20 years I could taste liver without puking, just 'cause I didn't smell it anymore, so no nausea.\n\nA couple years later and one very tasty liver dish with caramel, I not only don't get nausea at smelling liver, I actually find the smell GOOD... But that's also how I found out I hate liver after all cause the texture is *Blah*.",

Oven roasted parsnips beat out french fries as a side dish. I used to wilt spinach and toss with a little oyster sauce instead of pulling out a packet of ramen when I wanted a small meal.\n\nBut at the same time, when I make poutine, I'm making it with proper french fries.  A few times a year I make a giant bowl of popcorn coated in garlic-parsley butter.  And any get together with my inlaws is better with cheese puffs.  Because those are junk foods that I associate with those situations/dishes.",

                "text": "Most vegetables I blanche, and what makes them go down easy is I add a teaspoon of MSG-based chicken bullion to the water.  It's not as healthy as purists who eat them raw or unseasoned, but if it weren't for my special powder brew I probably wouldn't eat them at all.  If that method works for you, I recommend big bags of frozen vegetables.  All the work has been done and there's no additional waste.  Plus, they're cheap. \n\nI tried for years to include more vegetables into my diet but frozen pre-cut veggies quick boiled in seasoned water is the only way I can stick with it long term.  After a while you begin to crave veggies.  And since most veggies offer only a mild flavor, I tend to mix them into the more flavorful thing I'm eating.  For example it's not uncommon for me dump 2 cups of peas on top of an enchilada.  For spaghetti night, broccoli and parm goes on top instead of the half of cup of shredded cheese that I used to eat.\n\nOf course you cannot boil all veggies, but for frozen veggies I think that's the best option because freezing them ruins the integrity of plant cells and they get all floppy.  For fresh, pan roasting with olive oil works well, but I still don't prefer it compared to the MSG hot tub.",

Heat it real hot, put in Sichuan pepper for 10 seconds to toast, then put in oil and immediately put in vegetables and stir vigorously for 30 seconds, season with salt and grab them out. the flavor is somewhere between smoky and saladey, you want to cook it until just the point they're not raw. Moisture control is key, if your stir-fry gets wet and become a stew, it's no good. Keep the pan freakishly hot so all excess fluid evaporate.\n\nI cook with a tong. Honestly it is very consistent. My go-to is celtuce leaves, which is common from where I grew up a very close proxy is roman lettuce. I also do a lot of yam sprouts, \u8c46\u82bd\uff0c\u901a\u5fc3\u83dc, \u97ed\u9ec4.",

                "text": "Couple of quick recipes I tend to use over rice. Second recipe can be mixed with meat to give a stir fry that's good to go with rice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbok choy or kailan, rinse, chop (remove the base of the stem). Fry chopped garlic in a pan with a bit of oil (to ensure it doesn't stick/burn), put the veggies into the pan, you'll know when they're cooked because they'll be a more vibrant green. Once cooked, add a bit (half teaspoon or less) of light soy sauce to the pan and a bit  (tablespoon or so) of water; water is to evenly spread the saltiness of the soy sauce. let the pan go for half a minute, plate and serve.  \n\n\nBrussel sprouts, chopped in halves, pan fried with garlic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext one; Start with a pan of chopped garlic in a bit of oil (low heat). Chop half an onion, 2 pepper, (roughly a handful, so 2 large or equivalent) mushrooms (mushrooms optional), and a head of broccoli. (whilst the garlic is frying) Toss everything in and heat on medium heat, turning the vegetables as they cook so they don't stick to the pan; shouldn't need to add oil or water since these vegetables tend to \"sweat\" and leave you with water in the pan. Add a bit of light soy sauce to give it some taste, ensuring that it mixes in the pan; this time use the water that the vegetables have \"sweated\". If available, add a bit of Oyster sauce and Rice wine (shaoxing/Hua diao jiu/mirin).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to mix meat, fry meat on the side and add to vegetables as the vegetables are about done. Usually I go with a bit more prep; [Velveted beef](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-tenderise-beef-velveting-beef/) (coat diced meat with baking soda half an hour before frying and rinse off just before frying). fry the beef turning it to cook evenly, and when it's almost cooked add in a sauce of choice. \n\nMy flatmate and I prefer more savoury sauces so it's 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 2 tablespoons light soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons Hua diao Jiu. Mix in a bowl, add to the almost cooked meat, and reduce.",

                "text": "4 is pretty much the peak of pickiness. I found that between 5-7 a switch flipped with both of my kids and they started being open to trying things again, with encouragement. My elder kid is 9 now and will try most things at least once, and even has started liking a lot of more adventurous foods.\n\nMy tip? Keep putting it on their plate, and stop trying to force them to eat it. The battle is not worth it. I encourage a \"two bite rule\" at home for most foods (excluding stuff that is clearly not kid friendly, like spicy or hot foods), ie at least try two little bites for me, but I don't force it. If they don't want what I made, they can choose not to eat - they just don't get anything else instead. Yes, this has meant there are nights with some whining and nights where the kids (especially the younger one) have eaten very little. But if you're consistent with the rules, the whining isn't as much as you'd think.",

It\u2019s wild but some parents refuse to add vegetables to the grocery list even when their own teenage children are asking them because they want to eat healthily. I suspect it\u2019s because they\u2019re in denial that they\u2019re unhealthy and need to change, or they\u2019re poorly educated and the type to dig their heels in and scream \u2018disrespect\u2019 if questioned.\n\nThe most important thing is that your child has healthy options and is growing up safe! If you\u2019re providing that then you\u2019re giving them a good start to life <3",

                "text": "Sorry, I think you\u2019re coming from a good place, but no. Not inserting myself into their dietary choices is not the same as being toxic nor enabling their early death. Encouraging those you love to eat vegetables is fine but it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t respect their choice if they refuse, no matter how informed they are about their own unhealthy choice. Make sure you never take your concern too far and use it to justify controlling or judgemental behaviour.\n\nAre you this passionate over every unhealthy habit? Or are you only this zealous over food? By your logic every time your friends/family have alcohol and you don\u2019t try to \u2018encourage\u2019 them to stop you are enabling their early death. Are you also critical over caffeine addiction? Smoking? Living in cities with poor air quality? Being over worked? Do you remind everyone constantly to get their 30mins of increased heart rate activity per day? Lack of sleep is a huge cause of earlier deaths and long lasting health issues - do you require your loved ones to report on their sleep so you can judge whether they need your \u2018encouragement\u2019 to have a healthier sleeping pattern? Stress is an early killer too and a leading cause of heart attacks.\n\nNo one can make 100% of the healthiest choices, we all do multiple things that are unhealthy. Unless you\u2019re identifying and actively trying to fix EVERY unhealthy aspect of your loved ones\u2019 choices it\u2019s very hypocritical of you to accuse those who don\u2019t care about adults not eating vegetables of enabling early deaths. To reiterate, encouraging healthy eating is fine so long as you respect the adult\u2019s final decision (even if you don\u2019t agree). It\u2019s your lack of self awareness and accusations of others that make your comment toxic.",

                "text": "I love pretty much this whole comment. Such a nice way to pack up a lot of what others here are trying to address. Food can\u2019t involve pressure - but when it\u2019s casual and surrounded by love and nostalgia it\u2019s very easy to explore new foods. \n\nAs a serious conservationist hunter/fisherman, I do have to ask you to rethink your stance on eating shark at all. We never, ever target sharks outside of 3\u2019 class bonnet heads and bulls (catch and release as practice for heavy fights on light fly fishing gear). Here are my concerns:\n\n- first, shark meat is terrible for you. They are long living apex predators, and thus are potent bio magnifiers. Shark is loaded with heavy metals. They\u2019re also a pretty reliable source of ciguatera toxin. \n\n- populations are decimated across damn near all species. Eating a whole shark is better than just fins, but still isn\u2019t helping. Really the only excuse I ever have for eating shark is once every few years when a friend accidentally hooks a mako while marlin/tuna fishing and it dies during the fight (unavoidable area times, even when measures are taken to avoid hooking them. It\u2019s sad, and they kill themselves with lactic acidosis toxicity by fighting too hard). We obviously wouldn\u2019t waste an accidental kill and that meat gets distributed as steaks. \n- thirdly, it\u2019s fucking dangerous. Unless you\u2019re offshore and have a gun on deck, it\u2019s super hard to subdue a shark that you plan to keep. I\u2019ve seen large bull sharks on docks that have been shot dozens of times and are still thrashing and chomping. It\u2019s just not worth the risk of it getting ornery on deck while you\u2019re moving fast, only takes one slip to lose a foot (see The Perfect Storm for a hyperbolic, theatrical take on this)\n\nSo, please keep being an awesome and eclectic eater, but leave the sharks in the water. Global Mahi populations are booming on the contrary - eat them all you like and have no fear of heavy metals since they mature in a few short months feeding on primarily small fish, shrimp and squid",

I cook enough food at once so that I can have 1-2 days worth of leftovers to pack for lunch, so taking all the chicken and leaving me without protein is extremely rude. She refuses to eat leftovers, so it's not an issue to her if there's no chicken left.\n\nShe is more than welcome to go to the store, buy her own food, and cook for herself if what I make isn't up to her standards. She can also chip in money so that I can buy extra chicken (which I would be more than happy to leave in large chunks for her to extract easily), but she doesn't and I can't afford to get extra chicken for every meal. She's an adult (over 25), not a teenager, and I'm not her mommy.",

Not all the time, but if I'm on vacation (back when that was a thing) after a few days of restaurant meals, all I want is a plate of roasted veggies. I just feel better when I eat vegetables consistently. There are some that I love, like zucchini, I could eat zucchini forever. I didn't always like a lot of vegetables, and while my parents did a good job exposing me to a variety of foods as a child, they also made a lot of vegetables in the least enjoyable way (many frozen vegetables are pretty blah on their own). As an adult, I've both learned to enjoy things I flat out didn't like (for example, tomato sauce) and also to prepare things I thought I hated in ways that are much tastier (brussels sprouts, which I know have also been bred to taste better but trust me they are still not great boiled). It has taken time and effort for sure, and it won't happen overnight, but you can get to a point where you do actually want and enjoy vegetables and when you do, it will feel good.",

All of it... yuck.\n\nSo I blend and drink mine. My go-to\u2019s are kale, spinach, and carrots blended with almond milk, protein powder, Greek yogurt (for the probiotics) and two or three fruits, with ice blended in at the end to chill it and give it a smoothie feel. Tastes great, texture is no longer a problem, and I drink about 32 to 64 ounces per meal of it. I even am careful to have the veggies outweigh the fruit, at least half or more. I would like to use even less fruit than I do now, because of the carbs/sugar, but I trust the fruit sugar more than most of the crap I ate in my early 20s. I also just blend it, leaving the pulp behind to drink, rather than juice it. For the fiber and nutrients that has.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get to the point where I feel bloated when I eat that junk whereas I feel pretty darn good for the rest of the day when I drink that stuff.\n\nI try to do this for at least one meal a day, preferably breakfast or dinner.\n\nIt really is about the texture for me.",

If I need to, I pick it up, chew it, and swallow it, the same way I do with food I like.  I just enjoy one experience more than the other.\n\nTo me it sounds as strange as if someone refused to look at an ugly picture. The impression is that, they *could* turn their face and open their eyes, they just *choose* not to.\n\nThat being said, **this doesn't seem to be what you're describing**, so it makes me really curious. What happens if you put food you don't like in your mouth? Do you gag or throw up? Do your hands not respond in the ordinary way? Does your jaw not allow you to chew it? If you try to swallow it, is it scary like you're gonna choke, or sickening?\n\nIf I think about it, when I eat food I don't like, sometimes it takes me forever because I feel like I have to chew it longer or I won't be able to swallow it. Is it kind of like that?\n\nDoes anything different happen if you pretend to like the food, or does that make it worse? Does eating smaller bites help? \n\nAre you a supertaster? I'm a subtaster so I can't taste certain flavors, and I wonder if that makes it easier for me to eat food I dislike.",

                "text": "Slightly undercooking certain foods certainly can be a health concern but ironically pork isn't one of them.  I really like pork chops but baking them properly is a delicate fine art.  Most people who don't like pork chops don't like them because they've only ever had overcooked, dry, tough ones that resemble shoe leather or a hockey puck.  You don't want pork chops to still be bloody or raw, as that is unsafe.  But you do want them to be slightly pink in the middle with the juices just beginning to flow clear, which is perfectly safe and is the sweet spot for tenderness and juiciness.  When you take them out of the oven to check, cut into each one of them at its thickest point and inspect the inside, and then press on it to watch the juices flow.  \n\nAlso, if you take them out of the oven just before you reach this point and let them rest on a stove top for 5 minutes they will finish cooking in their own heat.  Take them out a few minutes too late, though, and they will seem perfect... until 5-10 minutes go by on the stove top and now they are magically too dry and tough.  Timing the oven extraction is crucial, as you seemingly have about a 30-second window before it lands in either the this-undercooked-bloody-thing-will-make-you-sick zone or the it's-dry-and-tough-and-I-hate-this zone.  My wife has gotten so frustrated baking pork chops that she'll prep them and throw them in the oven for me but will ask me to shepherd them home.  I tend to bake my thicker chops at no more than 375 degrees for 30 minutes and then check them every few minutes until they're right, which is usually closer to the 45-minute mark.  Thin chops cook faster and you need to start checking them after 20 minutes.  I have come to understand that perfectly cooking pork chops is a dark art that may require selling your soul to perfect.  Worth it though.",

                "text": "This actually makes me feel a lot better. I've recently been teaching myself how to for real-reals cook real food, and I've realized that I have this really weird aversion to cooking chicken. Beef, pork, lamb, fish, grains, veggies, whatever - doesn't matter what it is or if I've tried cooking it before, I have no problem just diving in and giving it a try. If it comes out good, great - if not, I'll try again and get better. Not so for chicken... I am TERRIFIED of getting it wrong. And I realized recently it's because of the goddamn war-crimes that my mother would commit with chicken when I was a kid. She only liked thighs, she would always get them with the skin on, and then she would bake them - unsalted, unseasoned - until the skin turned brown (but there were always still these gross, slimy fat deposits between the skin and the meat and... ugh). Until I was in my 20s, I just thought that's what chicken was and I didn't understand why people ate chicken (outside of fast food and frozen chicken, which I assumed was all made from basically McNugget paste). I never ordered real chicken at restaurants because I assumed I wouldn't like it. When I finally had real chicken I was blown away. Now that I'm trying to learn to cook it, though... I guess it's part of my overall childhood PTSD. It just feels like such a weird thing to have a hang up on, though. So, thanks for making me feel marginally less insane!",

I let her do it because, honestly, at least she's eating them. My niece is a super picky eater and I'm just grateful not to have to fight that battle.

                "text": "Can attest to this statement.  I have an awful relationship to food because I was continually forced to eat things I didn't like, and made clear I didn't like. I am also 90% sure I have ARFID, and the majority of my safe foods are found on a children's menu. I only have a few veggies I can eat (canned green beans or asparagus,  raw carrots but never cooked,  spinach in salad) but I still try to get my kids to eat better than me because I know I'm annoying. My kids have to give something a fair shot but I will never force them to gag stuff down the way I had to.  They both love broccoli,  salad,  carrots,  green beans,  corn; my daughter loves to try new things like brussel sprouts. My son refuses mashed potatoes which is odd to me (texture thing im sure) but still.  Everyone has things in life they don't like,  or physically can't eat and I am only doing my best to raise healthy kids that have a good relationship with food and themselves and I don't want to ruin that by forcing things down their throats.",

                "text": "Eh, it\u2019s a good starting point but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a cure-all for every picky eater. I mean, I went on a hunger strike as a young teenager over food things. I knew I would end up in hospital before I died. And when I was 12 there was a massive argument where I was grounded indefinitely because I refused to finish my plate, and I straight up accepted it and left the plate. I didn\u2019t give in on either of those, and honestly don\u2019t regret it despite suffering through the consequences.\n\nI was definitely a picky eater but when \u201cyou can\u2019t leave the table until you finish\u201d just led to 8yo me up past my bed time and half asleep in my chair, still not eating, it really didn\u2019t help my relationship with food. In my child brain it just demonised vegetables and associated them with a lot of negative feelings. There definitely needs to be a back up plan to \u2018eat everything on your plate or xyz\u2019 in case there\u2019s a kid like me where that normally good approach backfires lol. It wasn\u2019t until my 20s that I started to move past those negative feelings and learn to add more veges into my cooking. In hindsight I think I would have been a lot less picky if only I was involved in the shopping and cooking process, then I would have feelings of pride about the food I was eating instead of seeing my dinner and wondering how long I had until the fight started.",

I personally don't like to drink my food, but nutritionally there's nothing wrong with juiced fruit and vegetables if that's the only way you'll be able to tolerate them, and the same may work for your son!!",

                "text": "I get your point as a concept but have you ever had vegetarian food? Idk about you but eating food without meat, and I mean any kind of meat, makes me feel like I didn\u2019t actually eat. Meaning, I can tell what\u2019s meat when I\u2019m eating food, and I want it to be in every bite. Doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s bacon, sausage, chicken, steak etc... I can tell it\u2019s meat by the texture and \u201cmeatiness\u201d. When I\u2019m eating food, I have to have some crunch to it, so I basically neeeed vegetables. I can tell when I\u2019m eating vegetables and I can *really* tell when i\u2019m eating meat. So it makes sense that someone could simply not like the texture of vegetables, but it might be more than just texture, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily point to immaturity or something like that.\n\nThat said I do think people who don\u2019t eat vegetables are fuckin weird and very man child-like. When I was traveling I met some italian dudes that never ate vegetables and that was the least childish thing about them.",

They will definitely have options, but I generally like to include a lot of different vegetables in meals, and I am not completely changing up a meal just because someone's not used to eating vegetables. If they don't want to eat that part of the meal, that's up to them, but got to say nobody has ever taken offense. Rather than rejecting it, people are often really surprised how much they like it if they give it a shot (my record is a guy going back for a *fifth* serving of my meatball stew that was actually 95% tomato, leek and mushrooms with just token meatballs).\n\nIt's actually more likely that I have to hide some of the vegan option at barbeques for the actual vegans, because everybody else gets stuck into it lol. I'm not even vegetarian myself, but yeah, definitely converted a few folks just making actually tasty vegetable things and sometimes even hauling them off to a vegan buffet or something (which even the ex-bf who used to brag about once eating a 1kg steak - his favourite story to tell in *job interviews* \\- absolutely loved and used to bug me to take him back again lol)",

Only corn chips and queso at restaurants, nothing at all if they didn't serve that, craft mac and cheese at home, cheese boards, gas station nachos - for around 4 years, he only ate cheese and bread-like-things in different variations. He was frequently taken to the doctor. He was never diagnosed with ARFID, or anything of the sort...he was a picky eater, a bit OCD, lacked control in his life, hated living with his parents, and didn't want to use energy to think about buying/trying new things...just living in a happy little depressed, low-input low-output life. The cheese and bread were his moments of happiness. Not everything is a diagnosis...we are humans. An animal species. We are WEIRD.

I'm not saying they know better because you probably know that too - but they're trying to look out for you.\n\nDo you have this kind of reaction to ALL vegetables? Not just leafy greens but tomatoes, mushrooms, carrots, potatoes etc?\n\nIf chewing and swallowing is the issue for you (chewing is an issue for me too) you should try making smoothies. It can be an easy way to get your veggies without actually having to, well, eat or taste them. Just throw in a bunch of greens and mask the taste with sweetness from fruits yogurt etc.",

It's only \"garbage\" it it comes from a garbage fast food joint and you eat it with a heaping plate of greasy french fries like a 7 year old child. Otherwise a burger can be a perfectly healthy option when you aren't being an annoying shit who throws away all the green toppings off of it.",

But it's part of why restaurants like Chipotle and Taco Bell have such a bad reputation for giving people gastric problems - if you don't usually eat a lot of fiber, then get a meal loaded with beans and rice, your colon isn't going to know what to do with it.

Vegetables are these convenient foods that can be eaten raw like fruits, except fruits actually tend to taste good on their own.\n\nVegetables are made tolerable by doing everything possible to make them not taste like what they are...

So to answer your question:\n\nThere are two types of fiber, soluble and insoluble fiber. These do 2 separate things and can help in maintaining healthy regular poops. \n\nFirst insoluble fiber doesn't break down and acts as a collecting point. This helps to give poop bulk and helps your intestines to push through poop. \n\nSoluble fiber has many health benefits outside of just pooping. But Soluble fiber helps to bring water into your poop. This helps to make your poop not a giant hard rock coming out. This makes it softer and easier to push through your colon. But you need to stay hydrated to really see it's benefits. \n\nThe \"ideal\" poop should be like an over ripe banana.",

I don't care which. But they don't get snacks or anything else and I don't fix something special for them. If they're hungry, they eat what they're given. Take it or leave it.\n\nI'm not going to yell at them or punish them for not eating. That's not bad behavior. It's their personal choice. But I'm not going spoil them and let them eat whatever they want either. If they want to not eat veggies, I might just go full vegetarian cuisine for a few weeks. Then they can take it or leave it.\n\nI only have anecdotal evidence but I have a pretty big family and in my experience the kid always eventually eats.",

                "text": "Maybe if you\u2019d kept reading you would understand the point. Here\u2019s a bullet point list to make it easier for you and answer some of the confusion you had about the conversation.\n- there is an askReddit about whether anyone judges people who eat vegetables\n- I say no, because though it is unhealthy everyone makes some unhealthy choices and unless I\u2019m going to judge the entire world for their choices too it would be unfair of me to single out adults not eating vegetables.\n- you say no that behaviour is enabling death and cruel etc. etc. BECAUSE it is unhealthy and leads to an earlier death (side note: I understood your misspelt and grammatically incorrect \u201ctoxicly positive\u201d was about me and my opinion, not the comment, from contextual clues, so no idea why you think I thought you were calling the comment toxic. I very clearly never said that and actually called you out for judging people so hypocritically. But, given how you seem proud of not reading the comment I guess I shouldn\u2019t be surprised.)\n- I point out that if you think someone is horrible because they don\u2019t try to fix someone\u2019s unhealthy behaviour you would be a hypocrite if you didn\u2019t think the same about other unhealthy behaviour. That is how we got onto, among other unhealthy behaviours, smoking.\n- you respond not answering anything and trying to correct things I never said, and now we are here.\n- Seriously though, I genuinely want to know, do you constantly try to \u2018encourage\u2019 people you love to stop drinking, stop smoking, get enough sleep, lower their stress, etc. - or do you only care about proper vegetable intake. Because as I pointed out those are all unhealthy and lower someone\u2019s lifespan, just like a lack of proper nutrition does. Sometimes they\u2019ll even kill you earlier. Do you accuse the people who don\u2019t constantly try to get their loved ones to fix those issues \u201clazy\u201d and \u201cenablers\u201d who are \u201cstreamlining them to a much earlier death\u201d? And if not, why do you have sympathy and respect for those people and not when it surrounds food? Why don\u2019t you care about those unhealthy things as much?\n\nEdit: Since you mentioned \u201cwe weren\u2019t talking about x\u201d and wondered why I brought it up. I should ask you why you jumped to accusing me that I ignore loved ones who don\u2019t eat vegetables. I never spoke about loved ones at all. In fact, in my post I very clearly said \u201cI don\u2019t want to judge their relationship with food when I know nothing about them.\u201d If I was talking about loved ones I certainly wouldn\u2019t say I knew nothing about them. It\u2019s obvious I was talking about strangers. To my knowledge everyone I personally know does eat vegetables, FYI. You\u2019re coming in here accusing me of actions I have never done and nor said I have done, all with flimsy, hypocritical logic. You are the one who replied to something you didn\u2019t even read properly with hate, accusations, and anger. You should look in a mirror and do some soul searching before you continue flinging judgement at others.",

I do, however, think that **not searching for some kind of solution** so that you don't have to disclude an entire, very important, food group from your diet *is* childish.\n\nVegetables are a diverse food group. Saying \"I don't like vegetables\" is like saying \"I don't like grains.\"\n\nI wouldn't believe that a person couldn't find at least 1 or 2 things made from grains that they like or could at least tolerate. You don't like oats, wheat, rice, barely, etc. ect.? No matter how it's prepared? That is not believable.\n\nYou're telling me you don't like salad (tons of types--spinach, kale, iceberg lettuce...), carrots, fennel, celery, green beans, peppers, beets, asparagus, peas, cabbage, brussel sprouts, corn, artichokes, brocolli, okra, radishes, zucchini, cucumber, eggplant, cauliflower...? Not a single one? Not even depending on how it is prepared, either raw, boiled, steamed, roasted, blended (smoothies)? If the answer is that you don't like *any* of those, then you either have a serious  case of ARFID (which can be treated) or you haven't tried hard enough to find something you like.\n\nAvoiding treatment or not trying things are both childish.\n\nhttps://www.beateatingdisorders.org.uk/types/arfid#:~:text=Avoidant%20restrictive%20food%20intake%20disorder,a%20number%20of%20different%20reasons",

Either professional help if it is caused by ARFID (a diagnosable disorder that can be improved with treatment) or figuring out which vegetables can be eaten. \n\nVegetables are not uniform in texture, so saying it is solely a texture issue is not believable to me given that there are hundreds of different vegetables (with very different textures) and dozens of ways to prepare them. It might take some trial and error, but there's got to be at least 1 or 2 vegetables that he could work into his weekly diet. As someone else pointed out, smoothies are also an option.",

Writing everything out helps me stay organized and keeps food from being in the fridge past when it should. Plus it makes it easier to write out a shopping list.\n\nMy diet contains chicken/fish for meat (no beef/pork more than one meal a month), lots of fresh veggies to cook with, no restrictions on dairy products, low or no sodium canned foods, and whole wheat grains as much as possible (reduced carbs in general, but not by any means keto). It's not hard to shop for my diet, just a bit more time consuming due to needing to plan meals in advance. And I genuinely enjoy cooking and trying new recipes, so I don't mind cooking.\n\nMy roommate is perfectly content eating things like PastaRoni, frozen pizza, hot pockets, corn dogs, and other things that I genuinely can't eat due to high sodium/cholesterol/fat content/calorie content to protein ratio. On the rare occasion my roomate does go to the store, she gets food for just herself or buys things that I can't eat. If I don't shop for myself, this becomes the entire content of our food supply. \n\nSo I'm not her mommy in the sense that I'm not buying food specifically to cater to her, and I'm not gonna go out of my way to make what I cook more friendly for her if she's not chipping in food money. She's welcome to have what I make as long as she doesn't just pull out all the chicken. If she wants to buy and make her own food or order takeout, I won't stop her.",

She complained to her dietician that I wasn't cooking as often as I had been, so it was getting harder for her to take care of herself.\n\nI had just started classes for that semester and had to come right gome from work and log on to classes within 20 minutes of coming home twice a week. I cooked 5 other days of the week. I told her three weeks prior that I needed help on the two days I had class, or that those would just have to be leftover days. \n\nOne day we didn't have leftovers and I tried to make pasta quickly before my class. My roommate got home, saw me frantically trying to get pasta cooked before my class, complained that she was tired, and went and took a 3 hour nap instead of helping me finish cooking.",

And If it\u2019s like pickles or something that people sometimes really like, I\u2019ll offer it to someone else. But otherwise, just pick off the toppings you don\u2019t want and move on.

Then it\u2019s served on slices of bread like a sandwich but slices of bread that quite a bit thicker than normal bread, and I don\u2019t really see buns that are whole wheat. So we\u2019re dealing with heavily processed flour that\u2019s extra thick and high in carbs. Yeah... it\u2019s not a health conscious choice. Explaining to you that lettuce doesn\u2019t make a burger suddenly healthy is really fucking weird considering your stance on fries... pick a lane, dude... are you a health freak or an eat-what-you-want person??\n\nIf you want to eat a burger, go for it... but acting like it\u2019s some sin what people put on a burger is about one step removed from douche bags that tell you can\u2019t put ketchup on a hotdog. What losers to worry about such things haha",

                "text": "You haven't had broccoli and green beans cooked *well* then. Broccoli and green beans are so commonly overcooked by steaming or boiling, and it just destroys all texture and makes the color unappealing.\n\nTip:\n\nHeat up some olive oil in a pan, and add some finely minced garlic. Add your broccoli or green beans, season with salt and pepper (and red chili pepper flakes if you like) and saute them until they are glossy and bright green. Then, add just a splash of water - like a quarter cup and cover ASAP with a lid. They'll cook very quickly - take it off the heat and serve after a minute. They should still have a nice crunch to them.",

Nothing to do with fats or fiber.\n\nWhat fiber does is provide a bit more bulk to work with and increases the time where the colon pulls water back out, which can help if you just have a slow colon, but not if you've slowed your colon with excess sugar and carbs then you just hold on to more gallons of loose stool and probably make the inflammation worse until you get IBS or something that looks a lot like it.\n\nFat seems like it would be a lubricant but actually it isn't, unless something else in the tract is out of balance and not breaking it down before it's in your butt.

Which you probably won't if you've been eating sugar as if it's a vitamin like everyone has been forced to...\n\nIf a high fat diet was bad we would never have met the indigenous northern peoples, they'd all have been dead of heart failure or clogged arteries or whatever else we decided fat causes.  Fat causes zero of those things in absence of sugars (and carbs which convert easily to sugars) but there has simply never been a large enough study of peoples who do not eat any sugar but do eat a lot of fats.  Sugar is too pervasive to have any set of study subjects that would be \"blank slates\" for actual meaningful dietary data.  Also we ignore the biome and as such will never know which types of people are carnivore-challenged simply because they haven't previously had a diet conducive to healthy digestion and usage of fats for energy, and then they end up floating around clogging things instead exactly as advertised.  But it's really more of a chicken and egg situation and fat is not bad unless you're on a standard American diet of corn syrup and carbs with an occasional nutrient.",

So, a few minutes in the microwave then finish in the oven, total time ~10 minutes instead of 45.\n\nIt's not as good as only oven cooking, but I find it well worth the slight trade off.",

I honestly do try as many foods as possible and have found that if I can cook them some things aren't as bothersome to me (onions, peppers, broccoli, green beans) because I can control the texture more. I eat a lot of beans and pasta & take a lot of vitamins. \n\nLettuce is one of my biggest triggers, just thinking about it now is making my stomach turn. I get serious anxiety about eating with people I don't know (either out or at their home) because of my pickiness. Trust me, if I could get myself over it I would. I was exposed to a lot of veggies and fruit as a kid so its not a failing on my parents part. I am trying to expose my child to as many different foods as possible so that he doesn't suffer the same fate as me.",

I don't like eating greens and I do this. Put in fruit/yogurt if you like sweetness to mask the taste. Bada boom bada bing.\n\nBad diet is a habit and it is a habit you can break.

                "text": "There is another factor, perhaps even more important than simply how long it takes to digest something or how regular you are. Fiber provides nitrogen containing compounds and complex carbohydrates. Your gut bacteria feeds on these carbs and can process the nitrogen containing compounds for you. Nitrogen is very important for your neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine (which are monoamines compounds with a single nitrogen atom). Also, all proteins use nitrogen in their structure in some way shape or form.\n\nWithout a healthy gut microbiome, your body will not be able to get the full benefit that vegetables can provide. In fact, a lot of the gut imbalances that arise can be because your gut bacteria is adjusting to the new foods. Once your body stablizes, you should stop getting the runs (lol). After a while, the bacteria will live, replicate, and die within your gut. When they die, they release all their goodies to you. I think this provides a long term supply of the various chemicals your body needs, even when you don't eat for a while.\n\nFermented foods with live cultures are also extremely good for you. Kombucha, pickled cabbage, etc. As humans, we evolved to eat partially digested foods (cooking, fermentation, etc.) because our gut is relatively small to our body size. Think about what cows do, they eat grass and process it through FOUR STOMACHES to get any nutrition out of it. Our tiny guts are not very efficient at breaking down complex carbs, so giving it a boost (by fermenting it beforehand, for example) will open up a lot more of the nutrients to you.",

Which might sound bad, but if you drink enough, all of those things are beneficial for your guts]\n\nSecond, I would love to see a source for how sugar and carbs can lead to IBS. I was under the impression that the cause of IBS has not been pinned down yet, apart from it having a a multitude of origins of course.\n\nGosh I'm not saying that you should eat sugars and carbs for every meal 24/7 but your way of arguing seems awfully one-sided.",

                "text": "Because if someone's a vegan they'll be sure to tell you ALL about it.\n\nSame as why I hate overly religious types, evangelism and better-than-you-isms.\n\nI might know some vegans who don't do that but they probably don't jump up and down acting like I'm doing it wrong and constantly declaring \"I'm a vegan, I won't eat that\" in a tone as if they are better somehow.  They just do them and let me do me, how everything should be.\n\nVegetarian or pescatarian not quite as wacky/hardcore and usually not involved in evangelism to partially convince themselves their sacrifices are worth it, by convincing others of the same.  They are more like people who don't like ketchup, but don't try to make ketchup stop existing.\n\nVegans want meat to stop existing.",

                "text": "Ba da bing, ba da boom. I guess you've just put dieticians out of business. The post above was in reference to RFID, that's a bit more complex than 'bad diet.' A good, but restrictive diet can be nutritionally deficient. Speaking from scientific evidence, the reasons for a 'bad diet' are multifaceted, but laziness doesn't rank particularly high. But to keep things on topic,\n\nAs I already said, the texture of a smoothie can be similar to the textural issues contributing to problems with vegetables (smoothness, sliminess). There can be issues present with several different textures and so a smoothie isn't tolerable. Add some liquid thickener used for the management of swallowing disorders/dysphagia to your morning coffee if you don't understand what I mean. Smooth doesn't necessarily make a texture tolerable. It can do quite the opposite... \n\nIt can also simply be an issue unrelated to texture or taste, a phobia, related to routine and change, anxiety etc. Personally, I don't have much of an issue with vegetables. I am familiar with a blender. But I also know there's a reason people pay a lot for them and I've never had a cheaper one that could do a particularly good job of greens. Particularly to the level required in the context of sensory issues. Nor is relying on the relatively limited range of vegetables you can tolerably blend \nsufficiently balanced to remedy a bad diet, bada bing, bada boom. It certainly wouldn't be an managable solution for everyone presuming you're out of the house most of the day. \n\nThere's a reason we use a multidisciplinary, multifaceted therapy approach in the management of restrictive food intake disorder (particularly those on the Autism spectrum). Sensory issues preventing someone from meeting their nutritional needs with food (say complete restriction of vegetables) *are* inherently disordered. \nIf you think you've solved a complex medical issue with a walmart blender you're perhaps a little unaware of the complexities here. Speaking from experience, the non-verbal autistic child who will dehydrate before drinking a liquid that isn't orange juice box isn't lazy. People who have become dangerously underweight (as is a very real risk)don't do so out of 'laziness'. Nor are they likely to have not considered a smoothie before reaching the point of being unable to eat from an entire food group. Not being able to eat out at a restaurant, at a friends house, even being able to travel because you're anxious about how you will eat is debilitating. Whittling it down to \"just blend or your lazy\" isn't much different to telling someone with depression they're lazy if they don't just go for a jog.",

I eat fruit and vegetables every day but honestly, hate the texture of most vegetables. Especially uncooked crunchy greens like lettuce. So I don\u2019t eat it. I usually blend my healthy foods into a pulpy shake and make sure to get my vitamins and minerals that way. I\u2019d even say, the act of ordering (without making a big fuss or to do about it) a plain burger, isn\u2019t performative, in my opinion.

Let me take a step back and say I, speaking for myself, do get my vegetables haha, every day.\n\nPersonally, I just hate the watery crunch texture of,(usually) uncooked, vegetables. Like lettuce. I\u2019ll eat cooked spinach all day. Love green beans. I like Brussel sprouts fine... but the crunch of broccoli or cabbage just isn\u2019t my jam. Even cooked. Even covered in cheese (broccoli) or cooked in an egg roll (cabbage). I\u2019m just not a fan. The flavor is fine. The texture is unappealing.\n\nTo bypass that and ensure that I do get healthy nutrients, I usually blend my veggies into a shake with some almond milk, protein powder, greek yogurt and a couple fruits. I make sure the greens make up half or more of the shake and I keep all the pulpy residue for fiber. I have large portions of that for one, sometimes, two meals of my day. It looks ugly, but tastes great.\n\nBut because of that texture preference, and knowing that if I\u2019m eating a burger, it\u2019s because I\u2019m choosing, contrary to most of my other meals, to be unhealthy for that meal.

                "text": "Ketoacidosis and ketosis are not the same thing.\n\nIn ketosis, your liver is producing ketone bodies to substitute for carbs as a quick energy source. This is a controlled process, it's perfectly safe. Like you said, balance, ketone bodies are a safe form of chemical fuel for your cells just like carbs are, assuming the body is able to maintain control of their production usage. \n\nIn ketoacidosis, the cells are unable to use the carbohydrates in the blood stream because there is either no insulin (which they need to use their \"pumps\" to get carbs in and acid out), or they're so resistant to insulin that they can't use it. The cells start producing their own ketones, but produce too much acid and the blood PH goes out of control burning them up from the inside and wrecking everything that uses blood (so... everything).\n\nI'm not a big fan of ketogenic diets. I just hate when people get those things mixed up. Keto diets are not dangerous in the short run, and we still lack the data on long term health effects (since most studies of unintentional high fat diets have too many confounding variables - the difference between someone eating a keto diet of grass fed beef, nuts, and fibrous greens vs subsisting on fried chicken and greasy burgers is huge).",

But... I just don\u2019t like it. Honestly, the texture of the buttery tenderness of a pinker meat just makes me feel gross. I can do medium-well, with a little pink, but any less than medium literally makes me feel nauseous, personally, even if I accept it\u2019s considered \u201cbetter.\u201d\n\nI just compensate by almost never eating steak. Better for the environment, and I don\u2019t have to hear people tell me about how I\u2019m \u201cruining\u201d it lol. And, in my defense, I like to cook it slow so it stays tender even if it\u2019s done through. But yeah.\n\nPeople who boil vegetables are monsters though",

I guess maybe things like zucchini on the inside, but if we're talking about just basic greens the change in texture is drastic.\n\n> Speaking from experience, the non-verbal autistic child who will dehydrate before drinking a liquid that isn't orange juice box isn't lazy.\n\nDo you think the people above saying they don't like the taste/texture of vegetables are non-verbal autistic children?

There may be some genetic influence, but music taste is largely learned. What that means doesn't mean that someone taught you what type of music to like and dislike, but you subconsciously developed your taste yourself through your actions. The type of music you were exposed to as a kid, the music that you associate with specific memories, all of those contribute to music taste.",

Ketosis is the production of ketone bodies in replacement of carbs when we don't have any anaerobic energy readily available. An over production can lead to ketoacidosis lowering the blood pH to dangerous levels. While being mostly a problem for diabetics, it's not to say it can't happen. \"it depends\" is gonna be the answer for so many things.",
