Mushy and not a lot of flavor. \n\nMost veggies (including broccoli) only need to be cooked for a couple of minutes. I go by veggie color/texture but I think 10-15 min is probably more than enough for most non-root veggies (i.e. potatoes and carrots take longer)\n\nThat said, some veggies do stand up to freezing and can come out ok. I like to buy the \"asian veggie blend\" for making stir fry. Broccoli and water chestnuts seem to be okay even after freezing. The time save is worth it for me though since the alternative is probably not cooking veggies at all.",

Raw brocolli is tough and crunchy. As it's structure breaks down it will become softer. If it's cooked with liquid presesnt liquid like in a pot of boiling water, it will also absorb some of that water - the water will enter the gaps which are formed by its structure breaking down - this means you can season foods by cooking them in something other than plain water. Eventually the structure will break down so much that it falls apart and becomes mushy - this is the classic overboiled broccoli that makes people believe they don't like brocolli. \n \nIf you're careful and boil the brocolli for just a few minutes it can be crunchy and juicy without being tough. If you boil it in salted water or stock you will also season it a little. \n \nNow, what happens when we cook food without water present? We're still breaking down it's structure, but there are a couple of key differences. \n\nFirstly temperature - unless we're using a pressure cooker, water prevents food from being heated above 100 degrees because the water turns to steam which will remove any excess heat. Sometimes you want those higher temperatures because they enable chemical reactions which bring out more intense flavours, but it also means we can burn food it it's cooked for too long, and if the heat is too high or the pieces of food are too big you risk burning the outside before the inside is cooked - a common mistake when barbecuing. \n \nSecondly, you're actually going to remove the water which is already present in the food. The absence of water is what makes food crispy. Consider a potato. Raw it's tough and crunchy. Boiled it's soft. Underboiled it's a bit too tough. Overboiled it's mushy. But if you cut it into small pieces (so the water can escape more easily) and bake or fry it, it's crispy.",

Remember that most vegetables can be eaten raw, and in their raw form, they are usually crunchy and firm. Most people boil broccoli or steam it in the microwave to soften it up, but that can make it mushy very quickly. If you want it to maintain its crunch, either boil it only for a very quick period of time (like 1 minute) and then quickly put it in cold water, or just pan fry it like in a stir fry or something for a few minutes.",

Start with two minutes then check it. It will turn a much brighter green color and that is peak crunchiness. The more time you add, the less crunchy it becomes. I prefer mine slightly beyond that point, so I usually do 3-4 minutes, depending on how much broccoli I\u2019m cooking. Once it\u2019s done, I drain the water and add some salt and ICBINB spray. I eat this a few days a week as part of my lunch.

You can also buy them pre-cut in bags and some stores. Place them in a pot with about an inch of water. Most of the broccoli isn't in the water. Medium heat. Keep the lid on. When you start to smell it, it's done. Poke it with a fork to see if it's too soft or too crunchy. Or eat one. This is how you learn to cook. It's ok to mess up. The longer you steam it, the softer it gets. \n\nDrain the water, add salt, pepper, and a tablespoon olive oil or butter for flavor.\n\nAlso, raw broccoli dipped in ranch dressing is a favorite snack of mine - very crunchy! (I know, ranch isn't healthy... Bite me)\n\nWe eat steamed broccoli at least once a week, and my toddler children love it (go figure, those weirdos)",

If there was something to grill her dad made it, but otherwise all food was made by her mom, and the woman's taste could not be much more bland.  Her idea of seasoning seems to be \"drizzle some butter over it and put salt and pepper on the table if the butter isn't spicy enough for someone\".\n\nShe's gotten slightly better over the years and has a few signature dishes that are genuinely good, but sometimes when we're having dinner with them I'd rather just go to bed hungry.\n\nUnseasoned and overcooked veggies are the main thing.  Completely unseasoned meats.  Pasta with so little sauce that it literally just tastes like plain pasta.  I don't understand how she hasn't grossed *herself* out by now.\n\nMy father in law is probably a big part of the problem because he praises literally everything she makes no matter the state it's in.  I've seen him on multiple occasions say something like \"this is delicious, thank you\" as he raises his first forkful to his mouth, and I'm just rolling my eyes because it has to be obvious even to her that he hasn't even tried it yet.  They're so weird.",

The only vegetables I can eat are cooked green beans, cooked carrots, and raw olives. I feel super embarrassed. I've seen those clips of really fat people trying vegetables and gagging and that's literally how I also react. I really wish I could just eat them. I have no problem with the taste just the texture of biting into something crunchy (I only like chips in the crunchy verse) makes my whole body say \"no no not food\" it's so embarrassing to go out with people and ask for everything plain or with no veggies. I've often asked my parents why they didn't just make me eat vegetables when I was a kid and my dad says he \"would never make me eat something I didn't want to\" . My mom says when I was a baby I would eat everything, so I don't know what happened and why I can't eat them.",

I once tried to eat liver when I was 5 - kinda hard for a kid's digestion so I puked it all. And for the next 20 years, not only I wasn't be able to stomach cooked liver, I couldn't even *smell* it without actually getting nausea.\n\nJust to clarify, I have a strong stomach; when it comes to smell I can stand sewers, chemicals, gas, rotten fish, etc. But liver? Literally had to block my noise cause I feel vomit come up my throat, and if you ate liver you know it got a pretty strong smell. My mom's friend has this magic method of cooking liver with so much garlic the two ingredients cancel each other's smell, and for the first time in 20 years I could taste liver without puking, just 'cause I didn't smell it anymore, so no nausea.\n\nA couple years later and one very tasty liver dish with caramel, I not only don't get nausea at smelling liver, I actually find the smell GOOD... But that's also how I found out I hate liver after all cause the texture is *Blah*.",

I used to wilt spinach and toss with a little oyster sauce instead of pulling out a packet of ramen when I wanted a small meal.\n\nBut at the same time, when I make poutine, I'm making it with proper french fries.  A few times a year I make a giant bowl of popcorn coated in garlic-parsley butter.  And any get together with my inlaws is better with cheese puffs.

So I would try any kind of meat, but stuck to the same narrow range of vegetables -- iceberg lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, olives, peas, corn, peppers and onions were probably 95 percent of my vegetables for a long time.",

Heat it real hot, put in Sichuan pepper for 10 seconds to toast, then put in oil and immediately put in vegetables and stir vigorously for 30 seconds, season with salt and grab them out. the flavor is somewhere between smoky and saladey, you want to cook it until just the point they're not raw. Moisture control is key, if your stir-fry gets wet and become a stew, it's no good. Keep the pan freakishly hot so all excess fluid evaporate.\n\nI cook with a tong. Honestly it is very consistent. My go-to is celtuce leaves, which is common from where I grew up a very close proxy is roman lettuce. I also do a lot of yam sprouts, \u8c46\u82bd\uff0c\u901a\u5fc3\u83dc, \u97ed\u9ec4.",

                            "text": "> probably they've only had really poorly prepared vegetables.\n\nPeople keep saying this as if everyone around me who's having the same food as me is just lying about how nice their vegetables are.\n\nMy parents are good cooks. My wife is a good cook. I am even a good cook (so I've been told, and I cook with vegetables). I've been to countless restaurants where I'm assuming a large number of the chefs are good cooks.\n\nSo either every single person who's ever served me vegetables sucks at preparing/cooking them and everyone around me is a liar...OR, and bear with me on this one...I just don't like vegetables.\n\nI will clarify. I don't dislike all vegetables. I like potatoes done a certain way. Mashed or roasted(crispy) but I can't stand those mini ones that you just boil and serve. I like cucumber and I like raw carrots. Those are probably the only ones I actually enjoy eating.\n\nOnions I can barely stand. They're absolutely disgusting. I can only have them when they've been chopped to the tiniest sized pieces and cooked until they disappear and people say \"You can't even taste them\" so I question the point in having them in there at all.\n\nShoutout to /r/onionhate",

Second recipe can be mixed with meat to give a stir fry that's good to go with rice.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nbok choy or kailan, rinse, chop (remove the base of the stem). Fry chopped garlic in a pan with a bit of oil (to ensure it doesn't stick/burn), put the veggies into the pan, you'll know when they're cooked because they'll be a more vibrant green. Once cooked, add a bit (half teaspoon or less) of light soy sauce to the pan and a bit  (tablespoon or so) of water; water is to evenly spread the saltiness of the soy sauce. let the pan go for half a minute, plate and serve.  \n\n\nBrussel sprouts, chopped in halves, pan fried with garlic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNext one; Start with a pan of chopped garlic in a bit of oil (low heat). Chop half an onion, 2 pepper, (roughly a handful, so 2 large or equivalent) mushrooms (mushrooms optional), and a head of broccoli. (whilst the garlic is frying) Toss everything in and heat on medium heat, turning the vegetables as they cook so they don't stick to the pan; shouldn't need to add oil or water since these vegetables tend to \"sweat\" and leave you with water in the pan. Add a bit of light soy sauce to give it some taste, ensuring that it mixes in the pan; this time use the water that the vegetables have \"sweated\". If available, add a bit of Oyster sauce and Rice wine (shaoxing/Hua diao jiu/mirin).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you want to mix meat, fry meat on the side and add to vegetables as the vegetables are about done. Usually I go with a bit more prep; [Velveted beef](https://www.recipetineats.com/how-to-tenderise-beef-velveting-beef/) (coat diced meat with baking soda half an hour before frying and rinse off just before frying). fry the beef turning it to cook evenly, and when it's almost cooked add in a sauce of choice. \n\nMy flatmate and I prefer more savoury sauces so it's 2 tablespoons oyster sauce, 2 tablespoons light soy sauce, and 2 tablespoons Hua diao Jiu. Mix in a bowl, add to the almost cooked meat, and reduce.",

I have tried to like veggies for my entire adult life; trying new ones and trying new recipes, with very little success.  Apparently there is a \u201cbitter gene\u201d that affects how certain foods taste to people.  For example; eating a salad tastes like someone put grass clippings on my plate.  Even with meat, dressing, etc; I can only taste cut grass.  I wish I enjoyed salads, I wish I could even stomach them, but I\u2019ve accepted it will never happen.  \n\nThere are veggies I eat, and I\u2019ve found recipes to sneak them into for myself; so it\u2019s not as if I actually never eat them.",

                            "text": "I've always loved well made veggies, but I'm white. Dating a black guy who grew up on a mixture of traditional African-American (mom) and Jamaican (dad) cuisine I've been introduced to so many foods! Collared greens, curry goat, oxtails (my absolute favorite), jerk chicken, etc. So far I've loved everything! I absolutely love trying new foods and was so excited to try the stuff he and his family like. He said none of his friends are ever willing to try oxtail. One of my fondest memories was my gran asking what I was eating and when I said I'd ordered oxtail from a small Jamaican place she got all happy and said she hadn't eaten oxtail since she was a little kid (they were poor and oxtail was dirt cheap back then, considered scrap); I ended up letting her try a bit (it was prepared differently, so she wanted to make sure she liked it first) and then giving her 1/2 my dinner (it was enough for both of us) when she liked it because she just looked so happy. She died a few months later, so I really cherish that memory of sharing a meal with her that she'd loved but hadn't eaten since she was a kid.\n\nIn return I've gotten him into seafood. He'd only ever eaten shrimp and whitefish. I grew up practically living on seafood, it's very near and dear to my heart. So I got him eating sushi (he thought he hated it because he had only tried that nasty shit at chinese food buffets), calamari, salmon and swordfish steaks, lobster, clams and muscles, and even raw clam and oyster. He was a little wary about the raw clam and oyster, which I'll admit the texture is a bit off-putting, but he ended up really enjoying it.\n\nI love introducing people to food and being introduced to foods. I love people who are curious about new foods instead of being afraid to try new things. My outlook with new foods is \"worst comes to worst I hate it and never eat it again\" that doesn't seem like a big deal to me. The only things I won't try are like dog, cat, and anything too intelligent or endangered (so like eating a dolphin would be a no)... on top of anything cruel (like sharkfin soup... if they used the whole shark that'd be fine, I'm fine with people using the fins for one thing and using the rest of the shark to make steaks or w.e., but no they toss them back into the water to slowly die).",

Food can\u2019t involve pressure - but when it\u2019s casual and surrounded by love and nostalgia it\u2019s very easy to explore new foods. \n\nAs a serious conservationist hunter/fisherman, I do have to ask you to rethink your stance on eating shark at all. We never, ever target sharks outside of 3\u2019 class bonnet heads and bulls (catch and release as practice for heavy fights on light fly fishing gear). Here are my concerns:\n\n- first, shark meat is terrible for you. They are long living apex predators, and thus are potent bio magnifiers. Shark is loaded with heavy metals. They\u2019re also a pretty reliable source of ciguatera toxin. \n\n- populations are decimated across damn near all species. Eating a whole shark is better than just fins, but still isn\u2019t helping. Really the only excuse I ever have for eating shark is once every few years when a friend accidentally hooks a mako while marlin/tuna fishing and it dies during the fight (unavoidable area times, even when measures are taken to avoid hooking them. It\u2019s sad, and they kill themselves with lactic acidosis toxicity by fighting too hard). We obviously wouldn\u2019t waste an accidental kill and that meat gets distributed as steaks. \n- thirdly, it\u2019s fucking dangerous. Unless you\u2019re offshore and have a gun on deck, it\u2019s super hard to subdue a shark that you plan to keep. I\u2019ve seen large bull sharks on docks that have been shot dozens of times and are still thrashing and chomping. It\u2019s just not worth the risk of it getting ornery on deck while you\u2019re moving fast, only takes one slip to lose a foot (see The Perfect Storm for a hyperbolic, theatrical take on this)\n\nSo, please keep being an awesome and eclectic eater, but leave the sharks in the water. Global Mahi populations are booming on the contrary - eat them all you like and have no fear of heavy metals since they mature in a few short months feeding on primarily small fish, shrimp and squid",

She actually got the recipe from Mrs. Entenmann (like the Entenmann's cake family) back then they were a small company on Long Island and my grandmother worked for them as a secretary and actually knew Mrs. Entenmann (her first name was Martha) well enough to be sharing recipes with her. I unfortunately did not get this recipe before she passed away, she'd told me she'd written it down somewhere but when I looked in her recipe book it wasn't there... that being said I think I remember most of the ingredients and if I take the time I'll figure it out! Also want to add in that grandma hated modern Entenmann's cakes... she said back in the 50s and 60s it was a thousand times better, and the quality drop is just disappointing.\n\n90% of the times I've had zucchini or squash though it's disgusting mush to the point where I'm intensely wary of it unless it's made by someone I know can actually cook.",

Whether or not an adult eats vegetables isn\u2019t even a blip on the radar of problems I have with humanity.\n\nAdults who don\u2019t feed their kids vegetables on the other hand... those ones I get very mad at.\n\nEdit: thank you so much for the awards!

I found that between 5-7 a switch flipped with both of my kids and they started being open to trying things again, with encouragement. My elder kid is 9 now and will try most things at least once, and even has started liking a lot of more adventurous foods.\n\nMy tip? Keep putting it on their plate, and stop trying to force them to eat it. The battle is not worth it. I encourage a \"two bite rule\" at home for most foods (excluding stuff that is clearly not kid friendly, like spicy or hot foods), ie at least try two little bites for me, but I don't force it. If they don't want what I made, they can choose not to eat - they just don't get anything else instead. Yes, this has meant there are nights with some whining and nights where the kids (especially the younger one) have eaten very little. But if you're consistent with the rules, the whining isn't as much as you'd think.",

One didn\u2019t like mushrooms and still won\u2019t eat tomatoes, but will eat tomato sauces now (because I refuse to not make tomato based sauces anymore).\nOne doesn\u2019t like certain vegetables but will now eat BokChoy and other Asian styled veggies. This kid is also the only one that loves spicy food and adds sriracha or chilies to his food.\nOne won\u2019t eat cheese unless it\u2019s melted (this one I think might not be mine haha). Also my only kid that willingly eats beans and peas.\n\nJust keep offering. No pressure. I find making sure they get exposed to different cuisines early.

It cuts fat and there\u2019s growing evidence that it helps protect against a variety of neurological and physiological disorders. Meat only diets were used successfully to treat diabetes before insulin, it\u2019s one of the main treatment plans for epilepsy, and there\u2019s research currently being done to see how keto diets do with things like cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, etc.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s also not something a healthy person should want to (or can) maintain for more than a few months at a time.",

He's 3. It really helps to not demonize veggies, especially since they do actually taste good if you don't live your life eating cheeseburgers and pizza. I'm teaching him that junk food is good but not if you only eat junk food, there's a good balance in life. IDK our kids have always been open to eating veggies for the most part, the 3yo took forever to eat anything leafy like lettuce and the almost 2yo still won't touch avocados, but they both eat most all other veggies.",

It's just lazy and toxicly positive.\n\nAdults who refuse vegetables should absolutely be encouraged to consume them. Or to find a reasonable dietary supplement. Enabling is not ever the answer, you can not remain healthy refusing vegetables.\n\nSucks to have to do the job somebody's parents didn't do, but, to ignore someone and let them eat what they want at detriment to their health is the exact opposite of any sort of love.",

Not inserting myself into their dietary choices is not the same as being toxic nor enabling their early death. Encouraging those you love to eat vegetables is fine but it sounds like you wouldn\u2019t respect their choice if they refuse, no matter how informed they are about their own unhealthy choice. Make sure you never take your concern too far and use it to justify controlling or judgemental behaviour.\n\nAre you this passionate over every unhealthy habit? Or are you only this zealous over food? By your logic every time your friends/family have alcohol and you don\u2019t try to \u2018encourage\u2019 them to stop you are enabling their early death. Are you also critical over caffeine addiction? Smoking? Living in cities with poor air quality? Being over worked? Do you remind everyone constantly to get their 30mins of increased heart rate activity per day? Lack of sleep is a huge cause of earlier deaths and long lasting health issues - do you require your loved ones to report on their sleep so you can judge whether they need your \u2018encouragement\u2019 to have a healthier sleeping pattern? Stress is an early killer too and a leading cause of heart attacks.\n\nNo one can make 100% of the healthiest choices, we all do multiple things that are unhealthy. Unless you\u2019re identifying and actively trying to fix EVERY unhealthy aspect of your loved ones\u2019 choices it\u2019s very hypocritical of you to accuse those who don\u2019t care about adults not eating vegetables of enabling early deaths. To reiterate, encouraging healthy eating is fine so long as you respect the adult\u2019s final decision (even if you don\u2019t agree). It\u2019s your lack of self awareness and accusations of others that make your comment toxic.",

Mostly I just hate traditionally American sauces like ketchup, mayo, ranch dressing etc. I also just don\u2019t like processed food very much. The only really healthy thing I hate is fruit. I gag after eating a few bites even if I like the taste. I don\u2019t like pies or any desserts with fruit. When I say I\u2019m a picky eater, people usually think I mean vegetables but that\u2019s basically what I live on haha. I do love smoothies though so it\u2019s not just the taste. Except bananas are awful in smoothies  also lol.",

Too much tangy hurts and \"shocks\" my tongue/mouth.\n\nIf I had to eat vegetables or fruit it'd be no question. I'd absolutely rather eat vegetables.\n\nThe funniest thing is I am a vegan, speaking of vegetarianism and a lot of online health-focused raw vegans are always talking about how fruit is the best thing on the planet and most people need to eat more fruit, fruit deficient etc. talking about how they eat 20 bananas a day...meanwhile sometimes I will eat one banana in 3 days LOL and feel a bit called out. I don't really get it, I think it's pretty obvious vegetables generally speaking are healthier than fruit, but I guess that it's an easier sell because picky eaters don't like veggies.",

                            "text": "I don't regularly eat any vegetables. I occasionally eat green beans, but don't make a point of it. If they are a part of something, but not the main component to it, depending on the vegetable, I will have it (think fried rice, a tomato sauce if the re isn't huge chunks of tomatoes, something like that). I find vegetables not to be appetizing mainly due to texture. I have some MAJOR issues with food textures, like make me vomit if I try to eat something with a texture I don't like. I like the favor of many things, but the texture of it runs it for me (love strawberry flavor, hate actually eating a strawberry. I have tried plenty of properly prepared foods, I still don't like them. I WANT to like these things, but I don't. I keep coming back to them to make sure I haven't changed. I was always told I would like them when I grew up, and my parents always offered as a kid but never forced the issue. My wife lives veggies and I do most of the cooking, I have learned how to properly prepare them for her and she loves what I cook. I always try them and maybe some day I will come around, I am really hoping so. All of this to say, you are probably right about most people. I'm pretty health conscious, so I supplement. I have learned in my adult life, most people are bad cooks, and don't know how to properly prepare anything, much less things that need more help and precision. I pretty childishly avoided veggies and fruit through my teens (among many other things) but have expanded my diet since then with other things I like. I would agree that most people probably are being childish about it, tho I really try hard not to be.\n\nMy oldest son is autistic and I see a lot of myself in him when he eats. Super sensitive with food. Could probably eat the same meal day in and day out without an issue. We try to get him to eat other foods, but it is a big obstacle for him at times. Hopefully he comes around more one day, of not he will be fine.",

Carrots, raw or cooked? Peas? Bell peppers? Raw veggies can be dipped in hummus or mustard if lack of taste is an issue.",

                            "text": "I grew up insanely picky. I think it's from the traumatic experience of being force fed food as a kid. I grew up liking very little food, no veggies, and was of course obese. I used to have panic attacks if I had to go eat somewhere, because the thought of eating food I didn't want to eat was so treacherous to me. I was completely repulsed to the point of high stress levels when faced with, say, a salad. \n\nAt age 18 or so I couldn't live with the shame anymore, so I handled it the only way I knew how... by force feeding myself food I didn't want to eat. I had a few horrifying experiences at first, but no joke by age 20, I completely kicked the problem and the obesity.\n\n15 years later and I've kept all the weight off, and will eat pretty much anything. I'll eat the world's blandest vegetables and the ocean's squiggliest creatures. It's all good to me. Even food that I truly don't like (like watermelon), doesn't cause me any stress. I can just eat it with mild displeasure.\n\nDon't know if this method would work for everybody, but food for thought. It is pretty shameful for a grown adult to be such a picky eater. Plus, you really would be missing out on some truly amazing things to eat.",

It was easy, I had enough for lunch the next day, and I still had some fruit.\n\nWhen I met my partner, and he moved in, I started making bigger dinners and serving vegetables more because cooking for someone else gave me a reason to show off and make bigger meals, so I eat a lot better now, but there are some things I just dont like vegetables on. I could eat a salad and enjoy it, but I hate lettuce on burgers, sandwiches, tacos, etc. I just hate the texture it adds, but a side salad is great.",

As I understand it, any vegetables he eats either come out the exact same as they went in or give him horrible reactions on the way out- onion seems to be the main offender for the latter. His diet is very restricted but it's not as if it's because he's being a petulant child.\n\nMy fiance carries the same gene and had a similar surgery around 6 years ago. Thankfully the advances in technology mean that his could be kept \"internal\" and he doesn't have as severe a reaction to vegetables. Although beer and cheese come out like battery acid apparently.",

I have an interesting story for it lol:\n\nWe were going to stay at our mum\u2019s close friend\u2019s house after they came to ours. Me and my sister went there first because they had empty seats in their car and our family will go there the next day. \n\nWe reached their house just in time for dinner. We had pasta, it was great, until a big bowl of salad was served. It was a mix of Olives, Kale, Avocado and vinegar as dressing, mainly Kale. \n\nIt was a nightmare dish, it looks like a nightmare, it smells like a nightmare, it must taste like a nightmare. I hated Olives, I thought Avocados were gross and I definitely do not consider vinegar as a salad dressing. And then there\u2019s Kale, a veggie I\u2019ve never heard of, wonder what it tastes like. \n\nMy mum\u2019s friend put it on the table and said: \u201cserve yourselves, okay?\u201d And I thought \u201cI\u2019m definitely not gonna eat that\u201d. Few minutes passed and she walked past, saw my plate and asked: \u201cSuspiciousLambSauce, why aren\u2019t you eating the salad? Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019ll take some for you\u201d and she took a spoonful of it and put it on my plate. I\u2019m not good at rejecting people other than my family members so I just quietly accepted it. \n\nI scooped half a spoon of it and put it in my mouth. It tastes bad, like real bad. It\u2019s hard and spiky, I thought I was eating rocks. But I had to act like I liked it because it\u2019d be rude to do otherwise. There were like 5 spoons of Kale on my plate, every spoon was painful. But after a few minutes I finally finished it.\n\nShe came again, saying: \u201clooks like you liked the salad, take more! Aww... don\u2019t be shy, I know you eat a lot!\u201d *proceeds to take 2 spoons full of Kale and put it on my plate, again*. And that\u2019s how I came to hate Kale.\n\nI was just a 13 yo kid though, maybe if I taste it now I might like it but who knows",

I cant tell you how many meals I\u2019ve walked away crying from because they trigger something so specific, I cant even explain it. I\u2019m constantly saying \u201cIf I could like them, or even just tolerate them, I would.\u201d Its not fun to get teased constantly by people (ranging from friends and coworkers to complete strangers) and feel like your only options are A.) Spill the dirty details of deeply personal trauma to get them to leave you alone or B.) Pretend to laugh it off and feel even worse about yourself inside. Thankfully, I\u2019ve built a solid network of friends that I love very much who are supportive + positive, and care more about me eating flat-out than the schematics of my meal\n\nI beg of you, be kind to people who do things that you think are silly or immature.

She refuses to eat leftovers, so it's not an issue to her if there's no chicken left.\n\nShe is more than welcome to go to the store, buy her own food, and cook for herself if what I make isn't up to her standards.

I constantly crave bad-for-you food and have quite literally never thought \u201cI could could go for some veggies right about now\u201d.\n\nI\u2019m very slowly growing out of it but when you\u2019ve eaten a certain way for 20 years and all of a sudden now you\u2019re trying to train your body to want other things it\u2019s genuinely hard. It\u2019s like vegetables never seem fulfilling. Even my new favorites like grilled broccoli or peppers never seem to satisfy no matter how much I eat or how good they are. It\u2019s like breaking any bad habit though, it just takes time (and shoving as many greens in my mouth as I can).",

For me, it's more like a plate of food is not complete without at least one vegetable. I just buy the frozen peas that you steam in the microwave and have half the bag as a side with most dinners. It's cheap and I find that peas taste pretty good (kinda sweet and salty) and have a nice texture. For other vegetables, it's really just about not overcooking them so they still maintain some firm texture rather than just being soggy",

Not all the time, but if I'm on vacation (back when that was a thing) after a few days of restaurant meals, all I want is a plate of roasted veggies. I just feel better when I eat vegetables consistently. There are some that I love, like zucchini, I could eat zucchini forever. I didn't always like a lot of vegetables, and while my parents did a good job exposing me to a variety of foods as a child, they also made a lot of vegetables in the least enjoyable way (many frozen vegetables are pretty blah on their own). As an adult, I've both learned to enjoy things I flat out didn't like (for example, tomato sauce) and also to prepare things I thought I hated in ways that are much tastier (brussels sprouts, which I know have also been bred to taste better but trust me they are still not great boiled). It has taken time and effort for sure, and it won't happen overnight, but you can get to a point where you do actually want and enjoy vegetables and when you do, it will feel good.",

I think craving carbs, cheese, and meat is probably pretty biological. I really don't find eating vegetables unpleasant, but it's not the high point of the meal 99% of the time. My suggestion would just be to make yourself a small portion of a veggie you don't mind and eat it before your meal. Think of it like a vitamin supplement. I've gotten more toward one dish meals out of laziness, but I'll still have the vegetable on the side when possible and eat it first.",

My kid hates veggies, but I've had her try all sorts of ways to eat some. She like cold plain carrots, salads with lemon juice, and cucumbers the most. She'll tolerate corn, peas and bell peppers. She likes fruits more. I feel bad for adults who just don't want to even try different vegetables. Fucking roasted broccoli with garlic? That shit is delicious! Collard greens??? CABBAGE?",

As someone who deals with it, I\u2019ve worked extremely hard at adding vegetables (and other food groups), with relatively underwhelming success. There are few things I\u2019d like more than to be \u201cnormal\u201d about food, but it\u2019s not in the cards. \n\nI\u2019ve had to work at not internalizing it as some sort of character defect, because sadly that\u2019s how society often stigmatizes it.

I have never heard if this before, and will continue to do more research to better empathize with what people could be struggling with every single day.\nIn my past experiences,  the people I personally know that seemed to renounce veggies were less than healthy adults that thought all vegetables were \"gross.\" This idea was passed on to their kids and eventually grandkids, so in my head, this was just mind blowing to see a full grown adult refuse to \"eat her veggies,\" and then to see it directly affect quite a few people.",

Honestly, I have been striving to eat more veggies and while I did initially find it difficult, preparation is the key.\n\nHave you ever tried a veggie mix with some olive oil and apple cider vinegar?  I like bell peppers, carrots, onion, and cucumber mixed in that; shit is delicious.\n\nLift weights and want to add leafy greens?  Blend some protein powder, milk/almond milk, and some berries with like half a cup (15g) of spinach.  A splash of vanilla extract too if you are feeling adventurous.  I can't even taste the spinach and I hate raw spinach.\n\nYou just gotta be a little inventive.",

Slap all the butter and salt you want on corn, of all things, I still don\u2019t like it. Peas are even worse. All of it... yuck.\n\nSo I blend and drink mine. My go-to\u2019s are kale, spinach, and carrots blended with almond milk, protein powder, Greek yogurt (for the probiotics) and two or three fruits, with ice blended in at the end to chill it and give it a smoothie feel. Tastes great, texture is no longer a problem, and I drink about 32 to 64 ounces per meal of it. I even am careful to have the veggies outweigh the fruit, at least half or more. I would like to use even less fruit than I do now, because of the carbs/sugar, but I trust the fruit sugar more than most of the crap I ate in my early 20s. I also just blend it, leaving the pulp behind to drink, rather than juice it. For the fiber and nutrients that has.\n\nI\u2019m starting to get to the point where I feel bloated when I eat that junk whereas I feel pretty darn good for the rest of the day when I drink that stuff.\n\nI try to do this for at least one meal a day, preferably breakfast or dinner.\n\nIt really is about the texture for me.",

                "text": "I wish more people realized that, most of the time, when adults don\u2019t eat vegetables there is more going on than them just being childish. That can definitely be the case, but it sucks that people can be so quick to assume. \n\nMy parents kind of did me a disservice growing up by not exposing me to new foods. They just gave me what I liked. The healthiest things I ate were broccoli, carrots, potatoes, corn. I was this way until about 24, when I started dating a vegetarian. We were pretty limited on things we could eat together because of my pickiness and I felt bad, and immature, and embarrassed. I didn\u2019t want to be that way so I had to start trying new stuff. \n\nI can see why this problem persists, because trying new foods is HARD for some people. I have moved a lot of vegetables into the \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d category and that\u2019s about as far as I can get. I don\u2019t think I have ARFID or anything, but I have this incredibly strong disgust reaction to new foods. I can think something tastes fine or even good, but if I have this preconceived idea that a food is \u201cdisgusting\u201d (maybe from childhood?) then I just feel sick when I eat it. Continuous exposure can help but it\u2019s an unpleasant process and it\u2019s a lot deeper than \u201cbeing childish,\u201d which is something I have been accused of since forever",

I'm also vegetarian which makes it a bit fucked because that means I only eat stuff like rice, noodles, dairy, etc. I mean it's fine for me but fucked up when you look at it from anyone else's perspective. I eat fruits sometimes but not as much as I should.\n\nFor example, at university, I had pizza served with lettuce on the side every week and tried a bite of it every single time to attempt to force myself to enjoy it, and I just couldn't. It's a texture issue for me, there are just tons of food with texture I hate and many of them are vegetables.\n\nEven the ones I can tolerate, I would just rather have food without it to enjoy it more. Good food is genuinely one of the only things that makes me truly happy when I'm working full-time so I always want a great meal instead of just tolerating food I dislike.",
