By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.\u201d\n\nBut that would be incorrect since 800 is out-of-the-money and it's a sell. Out of the money you don't need to buy stock and cannot use that to show that you covered the shorts.\n\nOr am I missing something?",

If you were a trader and had 100 puts at $30 strike and all of a sudden the stock mooned to 300, 400, 500...but was clearly a gamma squeeze and fomo rush... you still had 10-15 weeks until expiration... Would you sell those puts for -99% when it was in the clouds, or would you wait for the price to start dropping to consider an exit? These MMs are not dumb, and they aren't as emotional as we are. They didn't close their initial shorts, they probably wrote MORE on top and closed those recently, maybe even today..The initial short squeeze was never achieved, the initial shorts were likely not fully covered, but masked to create doubt and hide tracks. The original thesis still stands. HOLD strong, look at all angles. Think like a MM. Think like an unemotional and criminal trader. They didn't sell for a 40% loss either this week, they were fully intending on profit when they saw -50% days. Hold, you will be rewarded, they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN. Fuck these twats.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards everyone. :) I love fake internet points just about as much as the billions we are going to syphon from the fat cats.",

Whenever I make a comment about looking at the math and not looking at the losses, I get a bunch of replies from angry doomers calling me a stupid bag holder.\n\nIt's very obvious that they are doing whatever they can to manipulate the stock price...and in the scenario if they double downed and re-shorted the stock at $400 with the intent to drive it down to $50 to buy back their shares, they're still sitting at a huge loss from the stock originally shooting up from $3 to $400 and they still can't get the shares from the ones holding like us to get 100% of their shorted shares back.\n\nIf I was an asshole hedgie in this situation, I'd be placing my bets on trying to drag this out as long as possible because people are emotional and impatient.

Imagine if, when they catch a shoplifter, all that happens is they get fined 1% of the value of the things they were stealing, then get to walk away with the stuff. That's literally how the department I used to work for made money, without the illegal activity they wouldn't exist.  \n\n\nBut \"oh the reputational damage is so much greater than the fine boo hoo\"",

That they actively chose to lock that in.  All of them.  \n  \nThere\u2019s no fucking way.  \n  \nFrankly if they did, they should all be fired for booking losses that have now evaporated just days later.  \n  \nThe only strategy I believe is that they did everything they could to allow themselves to wait it out.  The money from citadel and the timing of the RH fraud shows us that somewhere not much higher than $500 is where citron gets blown out completely.  They kept it under that, so they were able to hold and wait.  At that point they were paying a cost to hold per day that may be a significant fraction of their initial position, but it\u2019s not 50x their original position.  So they held.",

                    "Text": "They covered yesterday. Or late wednesday. They were taken off the threshold security list, meaning they covered at least the fail to deliver shares (late shorts). The cash infusion from outside the hedgefunds appears to me to have been held a few days and used once the price went down around 90ish $/share. They probably cut a deal to pay less interest on that than they would to the people who lent them the shares to begin with. And the loan is probably spread out over several years. They took a hit to get out of the jam they were in. They still have a lot of shares shorted, but they aren't due yet and so they can wait it out for a little while. The price is gong to drop in mid march when gamestop has to pay out the bonds they sold, according to the above post, which is probably why they were so shorted in the first place. We all have until then to get our money out. Right now, we all need it to drop in price so we can average down our positions to the point where daily fluctuations can get us out without a loss. If you're still holding come mid march, in my opinion, then you are going long long. I'm not waiting that long. I'm buying more low to get my average cost down to something reasonable and selling as soon as the price tops my average. If the 'rocket' takes off before then, great, but I'm not counting on it. I got in too late. My order got cancelled last thursday morning by Robinhood, so by the time I moved some money around and bought in I paid 315/share. Then they stopped all buys and the price tanked. We got screwed by the cronies. Some people make bank. Good for them. Th price almost certainly would have kept going up if the brokers hadn't stopped people from buying. The 1% protected themselves again. Even if the hearings on this or the SEC slaps some fines on them or makes some kind of rule change over this, the damage has already been done. They saved their asses but took a big hit to do so. I didn't make any money on it at all. At this point I'm just looking to break even or take a tiny loss. I'd hold but that mid march thing is coming up and gamestop has to pay those bonds. Best bet in my opinion for anyone who can would be to short GME yourselves right now. Get on the Melvin train.",
