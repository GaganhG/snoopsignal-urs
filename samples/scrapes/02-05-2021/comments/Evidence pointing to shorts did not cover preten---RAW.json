            "Text": "Numbers coming out the 9th may or may not reflect our thesis, doesn't matter.. consider this.. If you were a trader and had 100 puts at $30 strike and all of a sudden the stock mooned to 300, 400, 500...but was clearly a gamma squeeze and fomo rush... you still had 10-15 weeks until expiration... Would you sell those puts for -99% when it was in the clouds, or would you wait for the price to start dropping to consider an exit? These MMs are not dumb, and they aren't as emotional as we are. They didn't close their initial shorts, they probably wrote MORE on top and closed those recently, maybe even today..The initial short squeeze was never achieved, the initial shorts were likely not fully covered, but masked to create doubt and hide tracks. The original thesis still stands. HOLD strong, look at all angles. Think like a MM. Think like an unemotional and criminal trader. They didn't sell for a 40% loss either this week, they were fully intending on profit when they saw -50% days. Hold, you will be rewarded, they will loose BILLIONS AGAIN. Fuck these twats.  \n\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards everyone. :) I love fake internet points just about as much as the billions we are going to syphon from the fat cats.",

            "Text": "To believe the shorts covered, we must believe that substantially all of them covered at somewhere between -500% to -5000% of their original position.  That they actively chose to lock that in.  All of them.  \n  \nThere\u2019s no fucking way.  \n  \nFrankly if they did, they should all be fired for booking losses that have now evaporated just days later.  \n  \nThe only strategy I believe is that they did everything they could to allow themselves to wait it out.  The money from citadel and the timing of the RH fraud shows us that somewhere not much higher than $500 is where citron gets blown out completely.  They kept it under that, so they were able to hold and wait.  At that point they were paying a cost to hold per day that may be a significant fraction of their initial position, but it\u2019s not 50x their original position.  So they held.",

Thank you!\n\nIt's yet to be seen if they will be able to get away with it (in which case we stand to keep losing).\n\nEDIT: the question is: Can't the short in interest be still high, but the short positions are mostly new so there's a much much lower chance of squeeze? If the shorts are betting that the price stays under 40, or 80,;it would take huge jumps before we see a similar squeeze when the price was 20 (and the shorts were betting on near bankruptcy).",

I currently see their lines slowly crumbling on the ticker right now. It's slow and we (people still in the stock) are moving them back one bloody step at a time.\n\nThird, If we get a good report on Tuesday and can break through the line, I think we will see those tendies coming our way by EOD next Friday.

            "Text": "Someone has brought up this document before and honestly, after reading, it isn\u2019t bullish for a squeeze. Rather, the opposite. This tactic allows them to constantly push out the clock (seemingly indefinitely) because they are able to just re-up shorts and push out their failure to deliver dates. \n\n-Hedge Fund 1 (who is over short) sells deep ITM calls to Hedge Fund 2.-\n\n-Hedge Fund 2 sells shares to Hedge Fund 1.-\n\nThis makes it seem like HF1 is buying to cover positions. However...\n\n-Hedge Fund 2 exercises calls immediately.-\n\n-Hedge Fund 1 was supposed to be buying shares from Hedge Fund 2, but now owes shares right back because of the exercised options.-\n\nThese two actions negate each other, no shares are actually exchanged, and clocks are now reset on contracts/deliveries. This deal is setup beforehand between the two funds for a fee. It appears like HF1 has complied with share covering, however, they just perpetuated their position and resetting the clock. There is no limit on how many times they can do this. It\u2019s for as long as they are willing to pay a fee, which is likely cheaper than unwinding the trade and mooning GME. \n\nMoral of the story: expect weird volatility in GME for a while, but unless SEC forces them to unwind, they will accept any fines they get for \u201cpoor practices\u201d and happily keep their billions.\n\nFor reading this example, start on page 7 of the SEC document.",

            "Text": "Please, everyone contact your congress members. Particularly if you live in a district with a member serving on the house financial services committee. Here is a link to a list of committee members.\n\nhttps://financialservices.house.gov/about/committee-membership.htm\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI would like to bring to your attention some irregularities concerning the recent GME situation. In order to do so I would like to first provide you with a brief primer on how market manipulation works, then give examples of such suspected manipulation that I believe it is important for you to investigate in the upcoming hearing concerning GME.\n\nFirst it is important to understand what a wash trades and matched trades are. The following link from the SEC describes them on slide #25\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/files/Market%20Manipulations%20and%20Case%20Studies.pdf\n\nSuch wash sales and matched orders have in the past been used to manipulate both market volume and price. This practice goes back many years and continues today. The following link is another SEC document describing a situation where the market volume and resulting price were manipulated at above 70% of total volume for a year and a half. Please draw your attention to Page 12 paragraph 1 of this document.\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/id78grl.txt\n\n\u201cFinally, comparing the total volume of wash trades and matched orders reported with the total volume reported only on those days on which reported wash trades and matched orders occurred, from January 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, Broumas's trades constituted 73.7% of the reported market volume for JML Class A stock.  From July 1, 1989 to December 31, 1989, the applicable percentage is 72.4%.  From July 1, 1989 to June 30, 1990, the percentage was 73.7%\u201d\n\nHowever, this document is very old. I present this document to demonstrate that not only is this not a new technique but that in the past such things have been done at high volumes for extended periods of time. As a consequence here is an SEC publication as recent as September 28,2020 which involved the use of wash trades from June 2017 to March 2018\n\nhttps://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2020/lr24920.htm\n\n\u201cAccording to the SEC's complaint, from at least June 2017 to March 2018, individuals and groups who held large quantities of microcap stocks paid Zinkwich hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate a scheme to drive up demand for the stocks of certain issuers.\u201d\n\nNow that we have established how a market can be manipulated both in large volumes and for extended periods of time. I would like to draw your attention to a YouTube video of Jim Cramer, host of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and former hedge fund manager, describing the hedge fund playbook when they are in a short position.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMuEis3byY4\n\nIn this video, Jim Cramer describes how to manipulate the stock price down and describes a strategy in which Hedge Funds \u201ccreate an uplift, followed by a slow fade\u201d to produce \u201ca real negative feeling\u201d in order to \u201cbeleaguer the moron longs\u201d. If you look at the current situation, one might call this an accurate description of what is happening. However, this is not proof of any wrong doing of course. Just an interesting observation. However, Jim Cramer also says that it is also very important to get CNBC on your side. And here we do have some proof of manipulation. I would like to draw your attention to a post by CNBC made Feb 2, 2021 at 9:19AM, just before markets open. The same day that price dropped from over $200 to under $100.\n\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/02/as-gamestop-plunges-volkswagens-2008-short-squeeze-gives-an-idea-of-how-painful-it-will-get.html\n\nThe problem with this report authored by Yun Li, is that the graph that they present for the Volkswagen 2008 squeeze has been manipulated. Please refer to the image upload in which CNBC\u2019s graph is overlayed with real historical financial data using the same timeframe.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/a/PETRTdZ#zvRYOfj\n\nHere you can see that the market data is clearly manipulated on the CNBC graph in order to downplay the volatility prior to the 2008 VW squeeze. Obviously, the situation between 2008 and today is very different. As a result, you shouldn\u2019t be comparing the two situations at all. But I am not here to make an argument comparing the two together. All I am showing here is that CNBC presented manipulated data and that\u2019s a simple fact. Now of course if you look at CNBC\u2019s graph, they source it FactSet implying that they didn\u2019t make the graph themselves. However, this is a syndicated news outlet with professional reporters supposedly knowledgeable in their field, and anyone with a few minutes to spare can look up the historical financial data. Do you really believe that the reporter that wrote this or the editors that reviewed it didn\u2019t know that this graph was manipulated?\n\nLet\u2019s assume that you don\u2019t believe that CNBC made an honest mistake. Let\u2019s assume that you don\u2019t believe that Jim Cramer\u2019s description of the hedge funds playbook similarities with the current situation a coincidence. Then I would have to believe that at this point you might be beginning to wonder yourself if there is more going on here.\n\nWhich is why I urge you to call on the SEC to testify on this matter. The SEC has announced that they would be watching this situation very carefully. So I believe that in the interest of public trust it is very important to have the SEC testify as to what they are actually doing to protect the public interest. What records have they subpoenaed? What are they actually doing to investigate the matter? One example of something they could, and definitely should, be doing right now is subpoenaing the transaction record to look for matched pairs and wash sales and other irregularities suggesting market manipulation.\n\nFor example, take a look at this following image of 4 different stocks real time trade information as posted by Nasdaq.com at the close of Feb. 2, 2021.\n\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/rncscA9\n\nIf you can guess which one is GME, I think that says a lot. Again, this is not proof of any wrong doing. All financial transactions during regular hours are bundled and presented in the way that Stock C is shown. This is done intentionally to obscure individual transactions. However the SEC can investigate these trades in a way that an individual cannot. Considering all that has happened, I believe it is paramount to the public trust that the SEC be called to testify to determine whether or not they are actually investigating these obscured transactions appropriately.\n\nNot to mention calling CNBC to answer for their publication of manipulated data on the morning before a sudden market decline that so closely matches Jim Cramer\u2019s description of what we should expect.\n\nPlease, I implore you as a concerned citizen. Do not let these questions go unanswered. Why did CNBC publish manipulated data, and what has the SEC actually done to secure the public interest while watching this GME situation unfold.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned Citizen",

I could imagine their anger causing them to brazenly try to get out of this unscathed, not lose a penny and even further realize gains from their initial short strategy. \n\nSo it is Joe \u201centirely possible\u201d Rogan that this is correct. Even if it\u2019s not, I\u2019m holding. I\u2019m holding until GME becomes the Netflix of video games in 2028. I\u2019m holding until the same hedgefunds try to brazenly do the same exact thing with the same exact stock after they think enough time has gone by. \n\nThis is a historical cultural moment that will be looked back on as one of the original catalysts to a legitimate mobilization of the populace. I will frame this stock certificate right next to the picture of Bill Clinton when he finally gets convicted and right below my first M4A insurance card. WE THE PEOPLE! We\u2019re not done!

The market makers provide a required amount of liquidity to  the security's market, and take the other side of trades when there are  short-term buy-and-sell-side imbalances in customer orders. In return,  the specialist is granted various informational and trade execution advantages. \n\nOther U.S. exchanges, most prominently the NASDAQ  stock exchange, employ several competing official market makers in a  security. These market makers are required to maintain two-sided markets  during exchange hours and are obligated to buy and sell at their  displayed bids and offers. **They typically do not receive the trading  advantages a specialist does, but they do get some, such as the ability  to** **naked short**  **a stock, i.e., selling it without borrowing it. In most situations,  only official market makers are permitted to engage in naked shorting.  Recent changes to the rules have explicitly banned naked shorting by  options market makers.\"**",

By doing so, Trader A appears to have purchased shares to meet the broker-dealer\u2019s close-out obligation for the fail to deliver that resulted from the reverse conversion. In practice, however, the circumstances suggest that Trader A has no intention of delivering shares, and is instead re-establishing or extending a fail position.\u201d\n\nBut that would be incorrect since 800 is out-of-the-money and it's a sell.

            "Text": "They covered yesterday. Or late wednesday. They were taken off the threshold security list, meaning they covered at least the fail to deliver shares (late shorts). The cash infusion from outside the hedgefunds appears to me to have been held a few days and used once the price went down around 90ish $/share. They probably cut a deal to pay less interest on that than they would to the people who lent them the shares to begin with. And the loan is probably spread out over several years. They took a hit to get out of the jam they were in. They still have a lot of shares shorted, but they aren't due yet and so they can wait it out for a little while. The price is gong to drop in mid march when gamestop has to pay out the bonds they sold, according to the above post, which is probably why they were so shorted in the first place. We all have until then to get our money out. Right now, we all need it to drop in price so we can average down our positions to the point where daily fluctuations can get us out without a loss. If you're still holding come mid march, in my opinion, then you are going long long. I'm not waiting that long. I'm buying more low to get my average cost down to something reasonable and selling as soon as the price tops my average. If the 'rocket' takes off before then, great, but I'm not counting on it. I got in too late. My order got cancelled last thursday morning by Robinhood, so by the time I moved some money around and bought in I paid 315/share. Then they stopped all buys and the price tanked. We got screwed by the cronies. Some people make bank. Good for them. Th price almost certainly would have kept going up if the brokers hadn't stopped people from buying. The 1% protected themselves again. Even if the hearings on this or the SEC slaps some fines on them or makes some kind of rule change over this, the damage has already been done. They saved their asses but took a big hit to do so. I didn't make any money on it at all. At this point I'm just looking to break even or take a tiny loss. I'd hold but that mid march thing is coming up and gamestop has to pay those bonds. Best bet in my opinion for anyone who can would be to short GME yourselves right now. Get on the Melvin train.",

            "Text": "Hi OP here. I consider myself a student and not an expert but my understanding is that the original short squeeze thesis is based on the extraordinarily high amount of short interest being more then float, which means they'd need to cover the value of every share plus they'd have to buy back even more even covering 100% short interest to cover the rest. Therefore the argument to hold is to limit liquidity in the market so shorts have to pay whatever we demand - supply and demand - driving up the price\n\nAt the moment volumes are high but they could be a segment of shares that are just being traded with each other or very highly the volume include synthetic shares (I've seen several DD on here in the past pointing to the idea that retail plus institutional could well hold over 100% of the float right now because we are also holding some synthetic shares mixed in) - they need our actual shares to truly cover and I for one am holding. In my opinion that would make the volume argument not as relevant as your friend might think.",

Knowing the gaming industry and the fact that they already have brand recognition it seems crazy that they're only worth a few billion, on the very high end according to most.

And if they can create some sort of digital marketplace, such as with some type of key trading or something, I think that could be huge. I just don't know if that's even possible. But as a PC gamer I can say for a fact that we loooove not paying full price for games, and I would absolutely participate in a system like that.\n\nFrankly I got into GME because of the hype and looking to make a quick buck, but the more I consider it I'm starting to see where DFV was coming from.

They both include a traditional short interest number calculated the typical way. But, they also include a different way of calculating short interest which they label as S3 SI. This is not some new change. They have ALWAYS included the traditional short interest as well as the S3 short interest in their reports. \n\n\n\n\nPeople on WSB don't trust the S3 numbers because of threads such as the one you linked. But, those threads misunderstood the numbers which were being reported. And, this is what I explain in the post I linked.",

I believe people have done some rough math to show that they could have covered in low but frequent volumes in order to quietly DCA their way out essentially. They may have still lost money but much less than they would have if they let it play out the way we wanted. Not to mention that they could have shorted it further when it was at like $300+, essentially making back any money they lost. And it does seem silly to assume that they would be transparent enough to cover in an obvious way. I just don't know enough to say how realistic any of this is.",

            "Text": "It's hard to say exactly what will happen price up or down with the Hedgies. I think it is a big game of chicken. If it rises steadily then we will likely see who is smart enough to cut losses first and propel it up higher. If it's continually dropped down, it'll be a matter of them hitting their exit point, but that will trigger upward pressure once they do. Without knowing the entry/exit price and amount of these shorts it's hard to say the dynamics exactly. I've set my sell prices at sub 1000 and am confident they will be hit within a few months. It may go MUCH higher, but I'd like to capture profits and reevaluate my plans once i'm sitting on a few million. I'll likely play short term calls daily as well as some medium term OTM puts for the draw down after.",

They're happy, they made lots of money, and avoided the big decline. But now they're looking at it and it may still be shorted the same. Get in at $50 and ride it again?

So GameStop will have to pay back x sum. We\u2019re talking big numbers here (10m, 20m is typical per bond)\n\nGameStop may be considered more risky & if they have to re-issue bonds to cover their maturing bonds they have to pay higher interest rates on their debt (bonds) when they issue more.

The stock price didn\u2019t stay at $400+ for that long for shorters to be able to short such a massive amount and also cover their positions. \n\nIt takes funds weeks if not months to pile up their positions because they take such big positions. For any fund to be able to make such huge short positions in 2 days, if not hours, seems very difficult to me, even more so in such a dry market. \n\nNot impossible but i think people may be overestimating how many new shorts got added at $400 price levels. It\u2019s hard to pile up a large position in such short time, even if you ignore the crazy money it will take to take that position - which granted some funds can afford but in a market where being short is worst strategy at the moment, not sure how many would bet a huge money on it. \n\nI would have to guess it\u2019s more of covering of old than new shorts.",

I wanted to see if you tried to slip on the smoothness of you brain to bullshit.\n\nAgain synthetic does not mean the shares are fake or that they magically appear. It means the position taken has the same properties as going long on a share. In this case a delta of 1 is what is built out of options. No shares fake or not involved. \n\nI read the post and he doesn\u2019t understand synthetic shares anymore than. If you want please lay out the mechanics. It should 5ish sentences",

Or it may be lower. We don't know if S3's estimate is biased in some way. If it's as accurate as you seem to think it will be then it wouldn't be considered an estimate now would it?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe official short interest will likely be around 113%. I can't predict if it will be above or below S3's prediction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is all besides the point. It's interesting how all of WSB decided that S3's numbers were wrong because they couldn't look at the date of a tweet before making a thread about them. And then people like you will have no problems entering arguments about it without ever having looked at the actual numbers S3 reported. The bias is very apparent.",
