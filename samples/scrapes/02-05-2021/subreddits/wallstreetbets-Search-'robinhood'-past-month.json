I'll go through all these pms and comments this afternoon with my lawyer friend. Keep em coming!\n\nAnd please share!\n\nEdit 3:\n\nOMFG guys I'm getting 1000s of PMs! It'll take a while to sort through them all and reply, but keep messaging and sharing! Also if you were using WeBull or some other brokerage and got blocked, you might as well join too.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEdit 4:\n\nMy team and the lawyers had a conference call, and it's on!\n\nWe'll have an update in the next 48 hours with the procedures and next steps.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please PM me and I'll try to get through as many as I can once we have more details.\n\nEdit 1/30:\n\nWork is ongoing.

I'll update with more info as soon as it's available.\n\n2/2 Update:\n\nJust to let everyone know where we're at, my team is currently doing the research and building the case. This is a pretty huge lift though, so we're getting people on the team with the expertise needed to give us the best chance of success. It's taking time to get the most qualified people possible, but I want to do this the right way. I hope to have another update with good news in the near future. Thanks for all of the support and encouragement!\n\nPS, sorry guys but I literally can't open my Chats now. Probably has something to do with the 8.9k next to it....

This post was just out of frustration and memes over RHs bullshit corruption; I am not a laywer nor am I claiming that i'm going to create a class action by creating this post. You retards do as you wish, feel free to join if you want. Hell, use it as a backup in case something happens to WSB, I don't give a fuck\n\nEdit: Stop giving me these beautiful awards you retards, use the money on GME. \n\nThis is the way. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e. GME GANG FOREVER \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80 STRAIGHT TO THE Nth DIMENSION BOYS \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\n\nEdit 2: I will be acquiring more shares today. I have 17.7k liquid money in my TD. Bought 15 shares @327. Waiting for another dip to yolo 12.7k into the rest. I have 18 shares holding on RH with average cost of $112. 1000EOD Boys. Fuck the shorts, fuck the establishment. Melvin and friends can suck my fat diamond encrusted cock. Don't forget to leave RH a nice review on the app store thanking them for your gains\n\nEdit 3: I convinced my mother to yolo her stocks into GME early on @90. She still continues to add onto it and as of now she holds 147+ shares and is profiting well over 60k. I don't know what her cost average currently sits at but if my mother can \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e then so can you. She's more diamond-handed than me. Do your part brothers. We'll all be feasting on tendies from our golden plates and washing it down with Shitron tears as we wipe our asses with Melvin bucks by end of next week.\n\nEdit 4: I can't believe how much this is blowing up. I wasn't expecting it. But while I have the spotlight, I just wanted to thank every single one of you from the bottom of my heart. You tards have done absolute wonders for the community and started a financial revolution fueled by memes and autism.\n I read all these stories about how this community has helped people pay off their debts, care for sick loved ones, allowed people to give back to their local communities, and so much more. You guys are the true unsung heroes of this generation and are some of the most wholesome degenerates i've ever seen. This fight isn't about just tendies anymore, its about justice and equality, it's about sticking it to the corporate elites who run the world. Don't let these greedy scumbags take what's rightfully yours, for too long the little guy has been pushed and shoved around but now it's our time to shine. Keep up the good fight and don't back down. \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\ude4c\ud83d\udc8e for days boys, WE WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WE SEE ELON SHOOT A GME THEMED ROCKET FILLED WITH THE BURNT ASHES OF THESE BASTARDS TO MARS.

POWER TO THE PLAYERS!\n\nEDIT 5: Stop spamming me with awards and upvotes, you retards are crashing my inbox! Put forth all this glorious energy into GME.\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR: GME to 1,000 EOD, GME 5000 EONW.

        "Text": "Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...\n\nWithout Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like \"money market fund\" or \"moving average\"\n\nSomething like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.\n\nInstead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS \"difficult solution\" they did.\n\nAnd speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying \"lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors\". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.\n\nAnd yeah another reason why \"volatiilty\" and \"trade volume\" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.\n\nEdit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl\n\n\nEdit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....\n\n\n#FUCK YOU ROBINTARD. YOU CAN'T STOP US FROM LIKING THE STOCK\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80"

        "Text": "Vlad, CEO of RH and chief mod at r/cuckold, went on national news outlets last night and swore RH would open trading of GME. \n\nThat is not entirely true. \n\nRH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. \n\nThis is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. \n\nThey are simultaneously:\n1)  manipulating the system\n2) taking advantage of people with less funds\n3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased\n\nThey did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say \u201cWe reopened stock purchase of GME\u201d and nobody will dig deeper. \n\nThis is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. \n\nHere\u2019s the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa\n\nEdit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.\n\nEdit 2: I\u2019m not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas \u201cThe Shit Engine\u201d Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it\u2019s overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what\u2019s overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo\n\nEdit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.\n\nEdit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.\n\nHere\u2019s the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg\n\n#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.\n\n#I'm NOT FUCKING SELLING.\n\n#Edit 6: RH is now down to allowing a single share.  Thanks u/shithawks_circling for posting your image - https://imgur.com/a/BRDyxA0"

        "Text": "I just wanted to throw this out there in the middle of the outrage, in the hopes that someone can take it in and strategize, rather than be upset. Worked @ Merrill as an analyst from ** - **.\n\nI also like to keep it concise so follow along. This ain't a fucking Qanon fan fiction.\n\nDisclaimer: I own GME. This is not financial advice. This is just some dude chatting with his old buddies.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n1) **Robinhood, restrictions, suppression**: \n\nWhen you place an order through RH, Citadel or some other HFT front runs your trade and pockets the spread; However, the transaction is not complete.\n\nEnter: Clearing house. The clearing house is the intermediary between the counter-parties. Because they stand between sellers & buyers, they have very defined levels of risk, risk management and regulation to be in front of.  The clearing house is who gives you the \"title\" for your shares, the folks who make it official.\n\n**What Likely Happened**: The risk department retard @ the clearing house, who does jack shit all year other than flag Stacy's trade so he can get some face time with her runs to the C-Suite frazzled; He has looked at option open interest expiring this week, has done the math and there simply isn't enough float for GME in anyway, shape or form; turns out WSB is printing out their stock certificates and burying them in the Mojave Desert. It's simply not enough.\n\nIn addition, they got a Snapchat from SEC/OCC which said hey, if you fucking keep selling open positions, you're on your own; we ain't gonna help you. SEC is sneaky like that; they like sending messages through the backdoor, not the front because they used to be hedgies themselves. If you're not following, Front door is making a public statement while the backdoor is a threat sent to an intermediary who you and millions of investors don't even know exists.\n\nSo, they call up the risk department at RH and tell em to stop fucking selling GME, there simply isn't enough float, the SEC told the clearing house they're on their own and who tf is gonna take the blame/liability if there's a \"failure to deliver\"? \n\n---------------------------\n\n2) **Failure to Deliver**:\n\nThis is a pretty big deal because it's basically a slam-dunk law suit. \n\nFailure to deliver means that one of the counterparties (in this case, the firm who sold you the option, RH or the clearing house) has failed to deliver you a contractually obligated position, profit or certificate. Since there's no float and ITM calls get exercised by HFT bots at the end of the day, how in the fucking hell are they gonna deliver the option holders their contractually obligated merchandise if there is no merchandise to be delivered? There simply isn't enough for everyone. \n\nIt has been on the FTD list for a month already. Thousands (or possibly hundreds of thousands) of failures to deliver =  big risk\n\n\n---------------------------\n\n3) **Liability**: \n\nYou must be asking so what? Fuck them; They should be the ones figuring it out and they gotta give me, the customer, the right to choose or whatever the fuck; That sounds great in a boomer fashion but it's not that simple. Robinhood is contractually obligated to deliver you those shares or positions. If they fail to, they become liable for any losses or profits that you may have endured and they will LOSE in court cause they FAILED to DELIVER. How many people have options on GME on RH? Half? Imagine if half of these fine RH customers were legally owed benefits and they were engaged in DDoS style lawsuits involving Robinhood or the clearing house. There would be no Robinhood left. There would likely be no clearing house left. \n\nRobinhood is also a shitshow of a company, so they likely didn't even have additional collateral to put up to the clearing house for normal share buying and selling on the meme tickers and since they bank with T-Mobile, they had to pull the plug. This lack of collateral from Robinhood is important to note because the \"music\" never stops, trading low float/volatile shares just becomes much more collateral heavy on the side of the broker.\n\nHence: Bad Decision > Bankruptcy or worse (WSB finds Vlad's mom and becomes her boyfriend collectively)\n\n\nI personally don't believe it was out of malice or a coordination for RH; there's definitely coordination all around, but occam's razor says this is not such an ordeal.\n\n---------------------------\n\n\nCouple of semi-related notes:\n\n-Fuck Billionaires. Parasites of modern society, simply existing to leech off every slurp of alpha and take up resources meant for billions of poor people. Something is needed. Whatever is needed to discourage hoarding of resources of this tiny fucking planet.\n\n-I very much doubt that Ken Griffin and Citadel (the HF) would engage in blatant market manipulation or coercion of Robinhood or other brokers to make a few bucks on Gamestop or AMC. They cleared over 6 billion net last year, so just logically, it seems pretty unlikely to risk it for this. It is also very unlikely that Citadel Securities would engage in illegal behavior for the profit of Citadel, simply because it's such a money maker. If you were an evil genius, would you let your money maker go to shit because you were getting squeezed on some short?\n\n-The media just wants clicks and engagement, so they will bring the worst people on, simply to pad their own bottom line. Don't get engaged. Don't give in to them. Be the captain of your own ship and fuck over wall-street however you please.\n\n-The restrictions on the others tickers is likely proactive, not reactive. \n\n- **TL;DR**: There's simply not enough float and the broker/clearing house will fail to deliver on a large scale if they keep letting new positions be opened, hence restrictions.\n\n- **What will happen now**:Based on my previous short squeezes, Friday (tomorrow) will be nuts; All this gamma has to go somewhere and since there's not enough float, I'm guessing up.\n\nedit (2/1/21): Thanks for all the awards. I exited on Fri open. Now GME is likely in a holding pattern to crush IV. Best of luck to everyone."

        "Text": "Dear Robinhood,\n\nDue to your actions last week you forced many of us to make a decision of what platforms we will be using to trade from in the future. I personally moved all of my funds from RH to another platform. What you may not realize is that there are a LOT of people who did this as well. All of my funds will become available to trade with on Monday morning as I'm sure many other peoples will be too. \n\nYou fucked yourself and your friends... as come Monday morning will be a whole lot more capital ready to be reivested in GME, AMC, NOK, BB and what ever the fuck other stocks I LIKE.\n\nI LIKE THIS STOCK, I LIKE THIS COMPANY, I LOVE RYAN COHEN and FUCKING LOVE MY FELLOW RETARDS. We are not just lowly elite, we are the SUPER ELITE. \n\nAPES STRONG TOGETHER\n\nALL SHARES MATTER\n\nCan't Stop, Won't Stop, GameSTONK!\n\nEdit: \ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc50 GME GANG Going to fucking ANDROMEDA \ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83d\ude80\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\ud83e\udd8d\n\nEdit 2: It seems some people are still asking if its too late to buy. I value this stock at $4206.90 and that's what I'm willing to walk away with. I'm not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice. With that being said... a life with out taking risks is a life having to wear a condom EVERY FUCKING TIME while you continually pound Melvin's Ass.\n\nEdit 3: Next step.... we reached 320 this week and that was our target. Congrats all my fellow degenerates as we held the line. As you can see they are now offering up to 800 on next week's options. That's our next target. The squeeze could happen or it may not happen next week but we have a target in sight. They are trying to do everything in their power to suppress our valuation. Hold strong autists. We set the price. Prediction: GME opens Monday 500+ and we continue on our mission.\n\nEdit 4: A lot of people are asking me questions about what happened. I was trading GME since Jan 11th as a broke ass bitch, I threw in $200 played a nice $26 call before we spiked to 32 I was excited and cashed out to turn that into 30 shares of GME and hedged my way up to 55 shares over the following weeks. Im not rich, I think I just played this right move.\nNow here's what happened on Thursday... The Robinhood app blocked me from buying so my plan was to do a hedge on multiple platforms. Sell half on RH and rebuy after the inevitable ladder attack on my Webull account and then transfer my money there as well from RH. When I sold on RH they literally sold ALL of my shares not just my available shares since the others were locked up in limit sells. I panicked after that happened. And bought in as many as I could on my low funded Webull account. So I had to essentially sit out for the day. Friday full RH transfer hit my account and I set up a new account.\nAtleast I sold at around 380 and was able to buy back in below that. I owe about 70k in medical debt and GME gave me a chance at making up some of that, I'm +25k on a $200 investment, I need this. You need this. We all need this.\n\nEdit 5: now I'm hearing a lot about people talking about possibly missing the short squeeze if they transfer. In all honestly do you fucking care at this point? I don't. I'm all in and have literally put every dime I possiy could on GME I don't really give a shit about it. We are making these cunts bleed out. And if something at some point hits my sell limit I'll be happy, but if it doesn't I don't care because I KNOW THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING."

We've come so far. \n\nNow listen:\n\nIf you think Wall Street is shitting their pants over the GME short squeeze you are 100% right. Jim Bianco lays out a [convincing case](https://www.financialsense.com/podcast/19847/jim-bianco-gamestop-and-great-short-seller-takedown#.YBTK3GAFZmU.twitter) that SPY was down 2% on Friday because hedge funds were dropping their \"safe\" stocks to raise capital for collateral against their rising margin debt on GME. \n\nBut you also got to know this. At the same moment Robinhood halted purchases of GME, after calls from their hedge fund buddies, they also put on limits on $SLV. \n\n([Here is the list of all limited stocks](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/) \\- they've since added weird stuff like Starbucks, but $SLV was one of the first along with $GME and $AMC). I think that's pretty weird, considering that, unlike these other stocks, $SLV was up only a few percent on Thursday. It's even weirder when you consider that Robinhood had just been [bailed out by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-is-said-to-draw-on-credit-lines-from-banks-amid-tumult?sref=rY0z5sRB)! These fuckers are two of the worst silver manipulators out there. (Seriously. Link for [Goldman](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bank-nova-divestiture-goldman-sachs-idUSKBN1DS2C5). Link for [JPM](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html))\n\nThese banks have been raking it in on suppressing the price of silver for  decades. Look at this historical chart of silver. Does this make any sense? Silver was well over $30 for several years in the ***fucking 1980s.*** And now it's $27???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8rf9ip323je61.png?width=1914&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8bfdbed2e78d08ef1d411241adc6d68141ede47\n\nThe fair price of silver, conservatively is CERTAINLY over $50, but it seems that there were some strings attached to JPM and GS's little loan to Robinhood. \n\nI'm balls deep in GME, but am riding this silver train too. Already last week $AG and $SLV were surging despite Robinhood's best efforts. If this thing breaks, both of those tickers will at least double. My personal price target for Silver is $70. The tendies from silver will be extra sweet for me  - nothing like breaking up the greatest cartel in modern history (apologies to OPEC). \n\nKeep fighting the good fight apes. We'll bring these bastards to their knees. \n\nMy positions: $GME shares, $AG and $SLV shares and July calls. \n\n<Obligatory rocketship emoji>"

My answers in black below.\n\nRobinhood began to restrict retail investors from buying Gamestop and other stocks (AMC, Blackberry, etc.) this morning, while hedge funds are still able to trade these stocks. Please confirm, and can you estimate your potential losses as a result of not being able to buy shares at this time? I'm currently down over $20,000 and lost out on over $500,000. I have made a post to gauge peoples losses and they are in the 100s of millions.\n\nWhat is the firm that you believe poses a conflict of interest for Robinhood and what is the conflict? Robinhood is connected with CITADEL. CITADEL Hedge Fund is shorting these stocks and have lost 2-3 billion the last couple weeks due to the short squeeze. I have also read it seems to be a colluded effort by a number of brokers to block buying and only allowing selling of these specific stocks that CITADEL has interest in.. IBKR, TD, and CS seem to be working in unison to manipulate the market.\n\nWere you notified of the decision to limit buys by Robinhood? If so, how and when? Not until 11:30am this morning where they sent a notification. You would not see the notification without pressing around the app. The notification only stated \"due to ongoing volatility some securities like AMC and GME are position closing only\". So basically they are only allowing people to sell their shares driving the price down to benefit the funds that are shorting the stock...\n\nPlease provide any additional information that you think might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of your situation, and we will get back to you promptly. I have a few thousand people that want to join a class action lawsuit. A number of individuals are already reaching out to other law firms across the country. If you see the current news financial titants, congress members, and many others are commenting on the collusion market manipulation that is taking place on Robinhood.\n\nI'm working to gather more information but the damages can be in the billions..\n\nThanks!\n\nUPDATED 4:\n\nI HAVE A CALL TOMORROW WITH ATTORNEY.\n\nUPDATE 5:\n\nI had a call on Friday with attorney and he requested all proof, screen shots, and links to subreddits.\n\nHe is reviewing the potential for litigation and told me he will get back to me mid week.\n\nI will keep you all posted."

There's nothing stopping those of you who like this stock from buying itm contracts and exercising them as soon as you can.

Seriously, avoid robinhoopla if you can. This post is just giving you another option\n\nEDIT 3 AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: Anything other than GME is the wrong play.

GME dropped over 75% from its high not because just RH did this, and we all know it.\n\nMOST BROKERS DID THIS. MOST OF THEM.\n\nNow - go look at the front page of Reddit, the front page of your favorite news source, and the tweets of your favorite politicians. 95% of mentions of these shenanigans mention ONLY RH.\n\nWhy's that? Hell, you KNOW why deep down, but let's spell it out.\n\nThese prominent people - politicians, celebs, rich people, etc. - who are suddenly on your side would **love** to see **only RH** bite the dust. RH already had been disrupting the industry and taking business away from the established brokers who were charging ridiculous fees from back when you had to hop on the phone and call a broker to perform trades.\n\nThe second RH goes away, and other newer ones like WeBull get similarly targeted and scrutinized, what'll happen? Return of the $8+ per trade $1 per contract BS as the norm. Fees that go down with the more money spent, because brokers loooove rich people, and hate us and want to rake as much as they can from us.\n\nShould RH get reamed? Absolutely. Should all the other brokers that pulled these shenanigans get reamed too? You betcha. And right now, that's clearly not going to happen. I've not seen a single politician, including AOC, mention ANY broker other than RH. Hell, a congressperson drafted a fucking letter about troubling/concerning yada yada about RobinHood. Only RobinHood. **Again, MOST BROKERS did this.**\n\nFrankly, ANY broker that pulled this shit should be shut the fuck down. If not by the law, by their customers getting the fuck away from their thieving asses.\n\nSo, did your broker do this to you too? List 'em here. Hell, make a separate post about them. Upvote all of them. Let's not let them get away with this. They're trying to sneak out of a war they started and present RH as the lone culprit and make you feel warm and happy about class action lawsuits that'll get you a baconator in about 5 years. Don't let them.\n\nIt's clear the media and politicians all intend for those other brokers to get away with it. The ONLY way they won't is for us to plaster their names everywhere and make it IMPOSSIBLE to ignore."

They send them directly to Citadel or one of three or four other market makers.  You're betting directly against Robinhood when you use it.

Also their CEO looks like he's still a virgin, so how can he run a successful business if he can't even successfully dip his banana?\n\nThis isn't investment advice I just hate the company"

It's no secret that they earn money by selling all sales' data to the ''big sharks'' who can fuck us small fish up pretty bad. If they will lose huge number of users, their data will stop being useful, it will be too small sample of population to sell it to anybody. I don't give a shit, I am pulling everything now at loss and will continue using some Ameritrade or whatever. There are other apps that are relatively still for free. Ok, I am illiterate, I don't know how to support my idea with smarter terminology.\n\nP.S. Oh, yes, if someone will start complaining about this post, well, look at it as a bad review of robinhood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Recommendations for an alternative app are welcome.\n\nEDIT 2: ~~You don't have to sell~~ ~~and withdraw everything immediately~~,**(<<<-transfer instead->>>)** obviously that could also play out as an advantage to those that we are betting against, but at least try to cash out gradually. Take into account that it takes 4 days to be able to transfer the money form the app account.\n\nEDIT 3: [How robinhood makes money](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2020/08/19/the-inside-story-of-robinhoods-billionaire-founders-option-kid-cowboys-and-the-wall-street-sharks-that-feed-on-them/?sh=42fab76d268d)  \\- this explains pretty simply, after today's actions by Robinhood, do you really want to use app that is monitoring you and working against you with your every sale/contract???\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 4:  it does not offer OTC shares, some of which will go to Neptune in the next 5 years"

They have previously completely taken away buying power on these stocks from you guys, this caused serious backlash by users of the app forcing them to re-allow trading of these stocks, but not without a catch. There are purchase stock and option limits, which fluctuates throughout the trading hours to clearly manipulate the market, as seen with $BB and $GME today.\n\nThere also been plenty of people posting liquidation of their stocks without their approval, probably due to borrowing money on margin, but typically you should still have 5\\~ days to fulfill the margin equity percentage requirement.\n\nAnyways, that's besides the point:\n\nWhat makes you think these retards won't fucking limit selling due to \"technical issues\" or have ANOTHER \"outage\" AGAIN. They'll let the hedgefucks liquidate, then allow us to sell after all the hedgefucks are out. C'mon tards you've seen this shit before during the SPY put days.\n\nI'd move to Vanguard, Fidelity, or TD Ameritrade. Vanguard and Fidelity have $GME shares so surely they'll allow trading on $GME indefinitely.\n\nPositions:\n\n440 shares $BB\n\n6 shares $GME\n\n**TLDR: ROBINHOOD HAVE OUTAGE/STOP SELLING DUE TO \"TECHNICAL ERRORS\" DURING SQUEEZE.** \n\nEDIT:  \"**DO NOT XFER OUT OF RH.

Tried it with three different bank accounts. No dice. It either gave me a \"server error\" message, or it told me that a bank had to be verified.\n\nAt this point I'm getting bad vibes, try to post my screenshot (still pending with the mods), and leave it for a minute. Come back later on my PC and try again. No dice. Then, I think, well, let's try it with $100 instead of $600.\n\nAnd it lets me withdraw.\n\nOK, we'll try a bigger number.\n\nNope.\n\nNow I'm sus, so I fire up OBS studio and screen record all of this shit as I go through and attempt to get it to let me withdraw any amount larger than $100. Nothing larger than $100 can withdraw, but $100 (and presumably lower) can. I kept going right up until I run out of daily withdrawals.\n\nIt looks to me very much like **Robinhood is limiting withdrawals to $100 or less and pretending it's a server error.**\n\nThis can't possibly be legal, and I don't know how it could be a server error. I'm not as strong on comp sci as I used to be, but 100 is a fucking int and 600 is a fucking int and they're both three digits and should require the exact same amount of computational power to transact/calculate/whatever.\n\nAgain, I have screenshots from my phone, and I took a screen recording as I went through and did this on my PC. Can anyone advise whether it is 1) possible that it is indeed a server error, or 2) if not, how it could possibly be legal? Cause like I said it still fucking looks to me like they're just not allowing us to get our money out.\n\n**EDIT: These funds were settled. They had not been invested in days and were marked as being withdrawable. And if they were unsettled funds, Robinhood would have given me a message to that effect, not a server error/bank needs verification message.**"

        "Text": "The hedge funds are artificially lowering the price by not letting people trade. When there's no volume they can buy/sell at any price and that is the price that will show up as the current price. Even if only a single share was traded.\n\nThis is basically The People VS Hedge Funds.\n\nI'll be buying shares as soon as it's possible. The billionaires can sell their mansions and live in a normal house like the rest of us. \n\nFuck them."
